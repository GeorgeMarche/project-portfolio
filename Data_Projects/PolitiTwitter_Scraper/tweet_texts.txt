@baseballot Liberal clerk
If you wanna piss off a #Liberal tell em they can't kill babies...
@TH_1906 Nah. It's a clerk from one of the liberal justices. Guaranteed.
@hodgskin_thomas @viciavillosa @GravelInstitute Liberal revisionism is a disease.
@JoseSangiuliano @Timcast Probably a liberal law clerk… trying to get public reaction to influence the court
@egyptian_neenan @GOP I would be more worried about this Liberal mess🗑🤡
@LawrenceBJones3 That’s liberal speak for the most cowardice among us.
liberal: 7
@a_centrism Tbf, the decision itself is absurd. But yes, no doubt it will cause hyperbole like you’ve quoted.
@a_centrism Your feed makes me physically ill.
We just gotta keep voting for centrism, I’m out of ideas
So many moral panics, so little time.
i believe in center-totalitarian centrism with Orwellian characteristics
@APIrwin2 @a_centrism Does cinema count as fine art? I can name a few directors for sure.
This policy is the direct result of flaccid centrism paving the way for a united right wing. This is where the middle of the road leads!!
@JonathanAnomaly @a_centrism Rights aren’t dependent on states.
@alcocatshelter I'm sorry but aren't you exemplifying the very thing you're critiquing by saying my logic "reeks of radical centrism" lmfao
@DavidAOliverJr @a_centrism Lol not forcing child rape victims to have babies isn’t hysterical
@a_centrism Rightfully so. Deeply disappointing.
@a_centrism @ReturnVoltaire Not everything. Every human being dies for example.
@a_centrism I can already hear the thousands of shrieking tik TOK videos
this is what complacency with moderates and centrism gets when the opposing force is genocidal murderous hellspawn
@a_centrism It's probably good. Now maybe men can get some reproduction / parental rights in exchange for bringing abortion rights back.
@a_centrism Will be interesting to see where the polls are in about two weeks…
@a_centrism It will likely have no effect.
@polanskydj What in gawd’s name is “new radical centrism”? I for one believe in “newly rad awesome.”
@Inductivist @EpektasisJohn @a_centrism Most homosexuals are men
@a_centrism You're coping very hard today my friend.
@a_centrism That’s probably the point of the leak.
@6Shot38Special @a_centrism Citation needed. If nothing else most child molesters are people known to the children.
@a_centrism Biggest mistake R’s have made on abortion is linking it to religion. Basic humanism philosophy comes to the same conclusion.
@a_centrism Probably libertarian of some kind either ancap or left anarchist
@a_centrism Did gay marriage have a huge electoral impact for Democrats?
@a_centrism Definitely
@TardiveT @a_centrism Very true. Hence why the makers of the above video are being deceptive.

@tractorboy1983 @a_centrism I'm waiting 72 hours, too easy to think it is it's not my side...
@ruminantstars @a_centrism @AOC Lets see you re-figure this as the percentages of their ethnic population and see how that comes out.
@tractorboy1983 @a_centrism There should be repercussions whoever it was.
@a_centrism Yes, it’s very bad for Republicans because it will motivate Democratic voters.
@ben_weeks @a_centrism That's not what I mean.
@reneeaste @a_centrism Gotta be clerks for the liberal justices go put pressure on the conservative justices to switch their vote
@a_centrism Be on the lookout for The Great Reversal when/if Latinos start reliably voting Republican in substantial majorities.
@a_centrism I know leaks happen but not too often from Supreme Court. Interesting 🤔
@LastCasey @a_centrism Nope just nebulous culture war bs. Sorry.
@a_centrism Sure, like Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot....
@a_centrism Thinking the same... wondering who leaked it.
@a_centrism Most creators of great culture lean right. It's a fact. And there are obvious reasons to explain the phenomenon.
i believe in totalitarian centristic-centrism with Jeffersonian characteristics
@a_centrism I do not believe it will hurt them at all.
Students are bad because of centrism

@a_centrism this was true until marvel movies
@Steve_Sailer @a_centrism Fair enough. Politics attracts some weird types.
@Toomanycheifs @a_centrism Ideally in the Middle East or South Asia some where.
@a_centrism I disagree
@orbifolder @a_centrism Definitely a strong case for this. Shakespeare, Dante, Michelangelo, Botticelli, Mozart, Bach.
@VaclavHavel9 @a_centrism I didn’t understand the last sentence?
@live_intheflesh @a_centrism I'd disagree. That's the whole "alt centrism" "HBD" thing, anyway.
@Jordan99853878 This is like centrism but radical
@a_centrism Martin Luther King freed the slaves.
@Steve_Sailer @a_centrism The exception that proves the rule?
@a_centrism I also forgot, Jean-Pierre Melville of the French New Ave, its “spiritual father” was right wing too
@Kolo_Scoler @a_centrism Orthodox Jews don't believe any such thing.
@a_centrism Speaker of the House Denny Hastert (R-IL)?
@a_centrism Far right is still fine, if we count far-left artists as liberals this is fine as well
@defeatantiwhit1 @a_centrism I honestly can’t even find it anywhere on the internet.
@JamesSurowiecki @a_centrism Does Tucker say that somewhere?
@a_centrism This must be that renowned superior liberal culture you spake of
@a_centrism For the French new wave Eric Rohmer was a conservative.
@a_centrism James Earl Jones did it first (sort of).
@Race__Realist @a_centrism why did he include women like there's a possibility of a society without women lol
@a_centrism I look forward to the show with the pale, redheaded Irish woman as Igbo Queen. That will be a big hit

@a_centrism Revisionist psyops are getting fierce.
@a_centrism Before the transgender madness i would've picked the right-wing camp
@BlueBeeOmitted @a_centrism I don’t know who you’re talking about. Not the guy I mentioned.
@a_centrism I think conservatives’ contributions to culture are more in preserving traditions, religion, and a sense of national identity.
@a_centrism And you have no taste at all, you just follow the current hivemind like a bird joining a flock.
@czarivar A reasonably good synopsis.
@Pedro000710 @fishpainting @2024Hawley @a_centrism Maybe but even the socialists were nationalists and supported France in WW1

@MrAntonioSosa No we're not at all lost. @a_centrism
@WasLuther @a_centrism Right, so to you this is a cock fight. I'll let you win. Be a cock. A muted one.
@a_centrism @TheTheGrinch7 Black metal is technically virtuosic, and also unlistenable garbage.
@a_centrism You didn't really prove any points, you just called people dumb and declared yourself the victor.
@a_centrism There are too many exceptions to this to make it a rule
@a_centrism You're having the same amount of political brain rot as someone that says the nazis and communist were right wing.
@a_centrism I’m antiwoke myself, but i’d jump on that bandwagon too to resist going back to the office😂
@fishpainting @2024Hawley @a_centrism Even then Nabokov was one of those types

@a_centrism What do you mean by “‘life-affirming’” literature?
@Outis_Noman @AndrewHill_BBTV @a_centrism There is zero space for pedophilia in the platform of the far left, short of the .001% fringe
@GrantHayter I agree, but this thread isn't about "political art," it's about the personal politics of the artist.
@eladsinned @EpektasisJohn @marcoJcosta @JamesSurowiecki @BRazumem @a_centrism Someone needs a class in self-awareness.
@Steve_Sailer I can't wait for the suddenly "non-binary" Kenyans to crush these guys.
@a_centrism I agree with you, but must point out that politics and art make a bad marriage and worse progeny.
@a_centrism A different question might be: "What type of politics does someone have if they sympathise with, or support groomers ?"
centrism: 106

Hey guys I currently look like a straight conservative Christian girl rn but it was worth it for the hsm TikTok
If the Roe vs Wade is overturned it is a major victory for the conservative America. No doubt
@TheQuartering Unless they are a conservative.
@MeidasTouch Culmination of 50ish years of conservative energy. Let's see what happens when the dog finally catches the car.
Conservative justices will have their lives and the lives of their families threatened. The person who leaked this knows that.
@ELINTNews It’s a 6-3 conservative court
@tonytardio Wealth Creators😆. Typical conservative.
@secupp I’m sure you are against this, even though you are a “conservative”
@AlamoG72 Are the cities all liberal and all the sand conservative? LoL
@JonahDispatch or conservative clerk did, so discussion of the leak deflects some of the focus
funny what a single term of a conservative president can do to a country
@Mormonger I liked the thread but I was actually surprised when he re tweeted it, it wasn't a "conservative" thread in a sense
@kingofkgn Nah, find the right number of Conservative judges and it will be done.
@BuckSexton Excuses made for a conservative activist court desperately trying to save the criminal reputation of the corrupt GOP.
@ByronDonalds If SCOTUS overturns Roe v Wade, this will defeat the conservative movement in November!
@SockHorse @REMICKS8 @cami_mondeaux Actually a true conservative would riot over this.
This Supreme Court is not conservative it is radical reactionary
@CWSurprenant Perhaps look at the words “ultra-conservative” that preceded that statement.
@SusanDelacourt What about the Conservative Party Leadership race??!!
conservative: 250
@TheKobeStopper Lol. A actual libertarian would prefer the state to have the say rather than the feds.
@satancstarfish @JoelSuspended @axlsgirl13 again: stein voters don't matter any more than libertarian voters. they functionally cancel out
@Libertarian_247 I don’t think anyone would touch that nasty looking thing!
The ‘im actually a libertarian socialist’ dad at my sons karate studio - yeah man, you sure told me huh 🥂
@Notok_XD Your father is a libertarian, I see.
@Libertarian_247 Speaks pretty harsh about her character too…🤨
@Libertarian_247 She'll have to answer to Jesus someday.....
@Libertarian_247 This isn't real, is it?
@Libertarian_247 happy Monday and thanks for following back.
Hey you! Why aren't you following @HB4mayor? He DID win Libertarian of the Year here in Minnesota!
@brycejacksoncvt @StevenNorton33 @benshapiro Are you still talking fake libertarian?🤣🤣🤣
Remember, your worst nightmare may just be someone else's dream come true #vacatethestate #libertarian #RoeVWade
@LaziestofDans @USRoute41 @PekalaLaw Nothing more libertarian than saying it’s not the call of five unelected judges, its the peoples call.
@Estivel @Breaking911 You're speaking like a true libertarian, I stand corrected
I'm a libertarian, so I hate stereotypes.
@Libertarian_247 I donated to 21 clinics all in black Neighborhoods
@Alx_Libertarian That’s his plan?
@Libertarian_247 Yet no one encouraged HER mother. These people are just scary.
@Libertarian_247 She isn't going to like SCOTUS soon 😂
@Libertarian_247 So gross. I’m at the table eating dinner! Yuck!
@Libertarian_247 She's gotta be on strong sleeping pills! ...serously... STRONG sleeping pills 💊
@Libertarian_247 Too stupid to use Birth Control?
@MaxDaxMAGA @Libertarian_247 Father? I assumed it was one dude…
@Libertarian_247 Just reading that makes me so sick I wanna puke all over the place that lady is so low she’sBelow the sewer
@Libertarian_247 I know a girl who kept aborting kids bc she was having boys as she wanted a girl, once she got the girl she kept it
My favorite policies are those with progressive outcomes and libertarian implementations.
@Tommygunz722 @thedailybeast "don't tread on me but I'll tread on all women" I miss when libertarians were actually libertarian
Does the libertarian woman have thoughts on abortion rights? Why yes, yes she does
@Libertarian_247 She seems nice.
@Libertarian_247 she never had 21 abortions. she probably couldn't get pregnant after number 4.
@LurkerBored Oh it is, this state isn't poser Libertarian. It's the only state with legalized Brothels.
@Libertarian_247 I guess it's something to be proud of if you're batshit crazy!
@DJBranham Thank fucking god
@Libertarian_247 Sometimes I just fucking wished that the death penalty was a thing for these ones
@Libertarian_247 She is a serial baby killer if that shirt is accurate
@Libertarian_247 You are a very bad person. 👎
@clairlemon Congrats on your libertarian victory!
Nevada is a fiercely Libertarian state that believes in a woman's right to choose.
@RepMTG I love your dedication to your beliefs. As a libertarian I dont care about your beliefs
@Libertarian_247 Prayers.
As a Libertarian, Republicans and Democrats scare the shit out of me.
@Libertarian_247 I doubt anyone has slept with that female, much less 21 times lol
@umichvoter NV is crazy libertarian
@Libertarian_247 Pathetic
This one goes out to all the lukewarm libertarian bros in 2016. hope you lose all your crypto money.
@RaccoonCity96 @wandaIateIy He’s actually Libertarian.
@Libertarian_247 She looks scary..
@JonnyRedpllseed @Libertarian_247 Same here, I'm 43 yrs old I've been trying since my early 20's and can't conceive.
@Libertarian_247 What she left off her T-shirt was that she's also had one lobotomy.
@Libertarian_247 Awful
@TheMasonMusso As a libertarian, I would have no friends if I applied this tweet
You’ll now see, by their actions and inactions, just how libertarian the SV machers are.
@Libertarian_247 It’s a mental illness
@Libertarian_247 Which would be easier Having 21 abortions, or getting on the pill to prevent getting knocked up to begin with.
@xjoseyx I seriously want a job facilitating citizenship classes.
@Libertarian_247 how evil
@Libertarian_247 Cross your Legs Good Lawd🐇
@Zigmanfreud @CapitanBradford @elonmusk @tomselliott @mehdirhasan It’s funny because Elon is closer in libertarian viewpoints himself.
@cakeshaman @JackalopeRider1 @NickDAshley I would never be a part of the libertarian party.
@gainzxbt All of the sudden CT isn't very libertarian. Shocked.
As a libertarian I would 100% overturn roe v wade
@Libertarian_247 The whore strikes again! &amp; again,&amp; again, &amp; again, &amp; again, &amp; again, and again, and 14 more times at least!
@Libertarian_247 She has got to be completely hollowed out. Geeeeezz
@Libertarian_247 There has got to be 1 or 2 guys who are responsible for those 21…no way 21 guys lined up for this.
@Libertarian_247 I'm surprised she's been laid at least 21 times.
@Libertarian_247 That isn’t something I would brag about. Why didn’t you use some type of birth control instead of killing 21 babies.
@progressive_va @samstein @alexbward @joshgerstein Don’t worry, I’m proudly voting Libertarian this fall
@MastaEmil @Avaloncalibur @RetvrnOfTheMatt @ConceptualJames I'll keep being a libertarian
@umichvoter extremely libertarian values
So true 😂
@gunthrek @SCOTUSblog @benshapiro Your bio says you're a libertarian lmfao
@Libertarian_247 Either use birth control or keep your legs together!!
@Patriot79Baker @Libertarian_247 Vengeance is mine saith the Lord.
@Libertarian_247 @Bnmaui That thing should be sterilized.
@Libertarian_247 If only her mother had one.
Where are all of those libertarian bros now? You all standing up for women's freedom or nah? #HypocriteWhiteBoys
@tringe @Libertarian_247 If that draft decision from SCOTUS sticks, she’s not going to be happy.
@Libertarian_247 Spreads her legs for any man
@jfhksar88 Hey Jay Fong. So have you ever promoted crypto and are you a libertarian?
@Libertarian_247 For God's sake get off the crazy train.
@Libertarian_247 Eyes of a maniac.
@Libertarian_247 21 different guys ?
@Libertarian_247 Sick
@Libertarian_247 But but….the bird flu
@Libertarian_247 Maybe she has no idea how she gets pregnant ?? And I can’t believe a doctor doesn’t say “ No More “ !!
@Netskinette @Libertarian_247 Agree
@benshapiro arent you supposed to be a libertarian?
@Libertarian_247 What ever happened to a thing called birth control?
@Libertarian_247 Does it say "I'm a whore" on the back?
@Libertarian_247 I am absolutely against abortion but there certainly are times when I wish the mothers of EVERY democRAT had had one!
@Libertarian_247 You're special.
@Libertarian_247 She must be what you’re momma told you to stay away from. The street corner type girl
@Libertarian_247 This makes me ill. Such a disrespect to life.
@Libertarian_247 This is a very sick woman !
@a_centrism Probably libertarian of some kind either ancap or left anarchist
@acidropOSY Hate away, but no one held a gun to anyone's head to sign up for these loans.
@Libertarian_247 she must be a whole.
@Libertarian_247 How I spent my Covid money
@Libertarian_247 She will be now known as murder.
@Libertarian_247 What's that behind her?
@Libertarian_247 I bet that happy hole is wrecked at this point. Like trying to throw a hot dog dow a hallway and not hitting a wall.
@Libertarian_247 Their is a special place in Hell waiting for you.
@Libertarian_247 You should lose the right to be apart of the community. The removal of life is not a smiling event fyi
@Libertarian_247 She looks like a dude except for the hangers
@umichvoter Big-time libertarian tradition. “What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas”
@Avaloncalibur @MastaEmil @RetvrnOfTheMatt @ConceptualJames I'm a libertarian communist. You keep being wrong
@Libertarian_247 Hell can’t be hot enough for this bitch !!!
@Libertarian_247 She’s got the crazy eyes.
@Libertarian_247 Why do I wish her mother had had just one? 😏
@Libertarian_247 She can wear that shirt in hell
@JonnyRedpllseed @Libertarian_247 I pray for conception immediately for you guys.
@Libertarian_247 Bet you could drive a truck in that tunnel
@Libertarian_247 How did she even get laid once
@Fat_DTEA @OfficialSynanon @cheatlines Libertarian, technically, but yeah...
@Libertarian_247 Unbelievable!... Is this true?
@TabacchiTony @Libertarian_247 Thinking the same
@umichvoter It's a growing, diverse, economically libertarian place.
@Libertarian_247 So what she's saying is.... she's too lazy, selfish or ignorant to use birth control?
@trishtweety @Libertarian_247 Thinking the same
@Libertarian_247 This animal looks evil
@dougevansOK @Libertarian_247 Well thank you very much
@Libertarian_247 The question is how on earth did she get pregnant in the first place? Must have been some kind of kegger's🤨
@Libertarian_247 I feel bad about this woman. What the hell happened to her to make her this way?
@Libertarian_247 Some people have a dark souls and only care about themselves
@TechnoFlyBzzz @StarshipAlves @michaelmalice Who's a libertarian? 😆
@Libertarian_247 Which one?
@Libertarian_247 The top one I’d take for a roll in the hay. The bottom one eh…I’ll have to circle back.
@Libertarian_247 And a slut
@Libertarian_247 That’s between you and God!
@VAPatriot14 @harryspalding67 The libertarian solution for this problem would be competition.
@Libertarian_247 Wow, 21 guys hit THAT?
@Libertarian_247 I guess she's not religious because the 5th commandment is thou-shalt-not kill And yes she's a serial killer
@Libertarian_247 Just devastating… 🛑😞😢
@ufouapam @JeremyCorbell Personally I’d like to know if he’s a libertarian cause I don’t ever want to pay attention to him again if so
Should highjack libertarian socialism and make it as trad and conservative as possible
@Libertarian_247 Among many many other things.
@Libertarian_247 I can’t believe she got laid 21 times… serious misprint!
@StevenNorton33 @brycejacksoncvt @benshapiro No such thing as a pro choice libertarian. Abortion violates the non aggression principle.
I’ve made it. 😂 Too bad @verified still won’t give me a check tho. 😂🫠 #GA14 #Congress #Libertarian
@Libertarian_247 Dudes have abortions now too?
@Libertarian_247 Just gross.
@Libertarian_247 She found out too late all the sperm daddies were leftists----
@Libertarian_247 Or a hoe
@davemakes Yo at least they didn’t end up being hyper libertarian, conspiracy theorist like my first obsession 😹
@Libertarian_247 It still looks like a guy.
@Libertarian_247 Special place for this lady…
@lextune @StarshipAlves @michaelmalice “Simping for Palestine” are the words of a NeoCon masquerading as a libertarian
@saxocrat @libertarian_bee Obvsly not this year.
@lmaojank @libertarian_bee not this year
And Elon Musk (terrible name) exists because libertarian douchebag bros need a leader.
@Libertarian_247 Well we know she puts out.
@Libertarian_247 I bet she's a bed pooper, worse than Amber Heard 🤪💩
@Libertarian_247 Shit people
@libertarian_bee Could backfire.
@Libertarian_247 Isn’t she lucky that her mom decided not to have an abortion!
@Libertarian_247 Who impregnated this goon 21 times?
@erltonbunny1 @PierrePoilievre @PTC_Network Any law... he is a libertarian
@Libertarian_247 Sickening!
@libertarian_bee Do you think the GOP would pass a federal abortion ban?!
@DMckanebrook @TeaPartyer @hellpepper30 @johnrobertgage @politico I'm a libertarian mate
@Libertarian_247 Sick!
@ravenswood570R Trust me, I am. Enough women to make the difference in marginals and enough panicking men from the libertarian side too.
@Libertarian_247 She obviously is in control of her body after sex. Too bad she can't control it before and during.
@LouiseMensch It's opposite for me. I left Dem party years ago and went Libertarian. Rather vote Lib than Dem or GOP.
@JoeBiden Thank you for the information. However, we should vote 🗳 Libertarian.
@RamsiestheGr8 The beginning of your libertarian journey 💛🖤
@StevenNorton33 @benshapiro Depending on what type of libertarian you are, yes!
@Libertarian_247 Demented literally speaking.
@Libertarian_247 If she doesn’t go straight to hell, no one will !
@libertarian_bee Can y’a check? Lmao I’m tryna analyze something
@MaryRamji @Libertarian_247 I agree
@Libertarian_247 She does have that “Charles Manson” look.
@Libertarian_247 I wish her mom would have been as successful
@Aidan816104182 Don’t think UCs are legacy schools but idk
@brycejacksoncvt @benshapiro Is there anything contradicting libertarian philosophy by having state's write their own abortion regulations?
@Libertarian_247 She could have saved money on the shirt printing. “I’m a Whore” would cost less
@Libertarian_247 Have a hysterectomy instead!
@45GulagPrisoner @DeanObeidallah @elonmusk @tomselliott @mehdirhasan I agree. Isn't @elonmusk actually a Libertarian?
@printzstudios @Libertarian_247 That's EXACTLY what I was thinking especially 21 times fug no.
@Libertarian_247 Tragic. I cannot imagine how her heart and mind must have to escape such a reality.
@Libertarian_247 Does she know there is birth control
@Libertarian_247 How in TF did this chic find 21 dudes that desperate?!?!?
@archingwithaphd Libertarian, unless some form of anarcho-communism, has always been a right wing thing.
@Libertarian_247 1st snack of the day
@Libertarian_247 It’s ashamed that you weren’t #1 …. Just says
@Libertarian_247 And when you bow before GOD all 21 children will be there at your judgment.
@Libertarian_247 Is that even a female?
@Libertarian_247 "...and that was only what I ate yesterday !"
@Libertarian_247 Self admitting WHORE using murder as birth control
@NapervillePol This is why it’s so important to win in 2024. A filibuster-proof GOP trifecta would be the end of it all
You know who you are…
@Libertarian_247 This is one of the most disgusting things I’ve ever seen!! I pray it’s not true.
@Libertarian_247 She is a serial killer bragging about her accomplishment
@Libertarian_247 Why would anyone be proud of an abortion? There are some really demented ppl in this world.
@Libertarian_247 She is
@libertarian_bee You know there’s a non zero chance that a 6 week abortion ban happens at the federal level right?
Old school Tweeter 😂
@Libertarian_247 Another reason for forced sterilization
@Libertarian_247 Damnit man 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@Libertarian_247 Ohh man 🤦
@Libertarian_247 21 babies ? You need to stop having sex with so many men 🙄
@Libertarian_247 I would support a sex change for her... sad to say that.. but it could save lives
@Libertarian_247 could be a good thing her line will stop with her or she should just keep her dam legs closed
@GardnerNessy @Libertarian_247 i think you got the psychopath part correct..
@Libertarian_247 Special place in hell for people like her.
@Libertarian_247 Her face says it all
@Libertarian_247 i wonder if they wait to see her on the other side... nah... they're in a better place than she will be..
When the Twitter takeover is complete 😂
@Libertarian_247 If she had a brain she could make money producing kids.
@libertarian_bee I’ll be coming at 18, see y’a in Laguna Beach
@Libertarian_247 Sick
@Libertarian_247 Someone got her pregnant 21 times?!
@Libertarian_247 I hope she takes her suntan lotion with her. She is headed for a very special place.
@libertarian_bee Same...
@Libertarian_247 Geez!! Teach some one to pull out or how babies are made.
@CBaker_F1 @badlandj @MaximeBernier Canada, especially rural, was very libertarian during the early 20th century and prior
@Libertarian_247 Basically she is saying she is too stupid to figure out us birth control.
@Libertarian_247 Look at the eyes.
@Libertarian_247 Means she's definitely a slut
@Libertarian_247 Who would even hit that? 🤮🤮🤮
@Libertarian_247 She looks like someone who's had 21 abortions
@Libertarian_247 Should be in prison!!!
@Libertarian_247 @mfar57 That’s some trash right there.
@Libertarian_247 It should say I’m a moron and I don’t know how to take birth control that I can get for free but I’d rather abort a baby😳
@Libertarian_247 No wonder she looks soulless... 😑
@Libertarian_247 If only this woman's father would have worn a condom. Could have stopped 21 murders
@InfuseMe @SwipeWright MyPOV: i would agree with that. I think i'm getting to be more fiscally responsible and libertarian in my old age =)
@Libertarian_247 Birth control???
@Libertarian_247 I really dont know if i can condone abortions but on the other hand 21 less liberals.
@Libertarian_247 Maybe she should learn to swallow
@Libertarian_247 Birth control, remember that???
@DavidSkarbek Sweet! If you dig it, give it a retweet. I’m Trying to grow my readership amongst the libertarian/econ set
@Libertarian_247 Too dumb to buy a rubber or a 6 dollar mos prescription
@Libertarian_247 If abortion wasn't so easily available, maybe people would invest the dollar or so for a condom
@RichardGrenell Elon Musk is there. He’s libertarian but I’d put him a right wing these days.
@Buffalo_butt4 I don't like the libertarian party either, they embrace too many woke ideas for my taste.
@Libertarian_247 21 donations to Moloch, and her body still looks like this? she should have sold her souls to Billy Blanks.
@Libertarian_247 That’s seriously messed up. Use some damn birth control.
@Libertarian_247 The only thing missing in this picture is Brandon and his pos son with similar captions
@ElGranSenglar Good choice
@Libertarian_247 How pathetic.
@Libertarian_247 Close your legs!
@Libertarian_247 I hope she was a prostitute
@Libertarian_247 Unbelievable !
@janafromcali But I picked liberal
@Libertarian_247 What’s even more disturbing than her abortions is that 21 people f—ked her
@Libertarian_247 Or a HO!
@janafromcali I’m between liberal and leftist, not quite one of the other
@Libertarian_247 I’m going to pray for her! So sad.
@Libertarian_247 Totally ridiculous, she is so sad.

I miss having a real Liberal party in BC. Fucking SoCreds hijacked it.
@bfry1981 @POLITICOEurope Wrong; NATO or no NATO, Putin couldn’t have a successful liberal democracy on his border.
@MattWalshBlog if liberal women cared about their “right to birth control” as strongly as killing children, they wouldn’t need an abortion
@RationaIist @lisa_liberal @kenjeong No longer a @kenjeong fan. Keep the politics out. Can we ever just enjoy the show??!! 😡
@GreekFire23 Latest liberal ploy to distract us ...now with HORNY ALIENS 👽🍆💦
@Bri4Change1 Liberal hypocrites “My body my choice, except with a vaccine”
@Harovdadawg66 Yes, because that’s going to work in cases of rape or incests. P.S. not just the liberal women.
@freekev22 @TheRickWilson Yeah, we’ll all feel just great when it becomes 12 conservatives and 1 liberal.
@duarteamanda Typical Liberal..

@alsoabouteve it solidified me as moving into centrism tbh
@a_centrism @aaronsibarium @bariweiss The best and brightest!
@RidnWthBiden @JustAliceRem1 I'm praying that you recover and turn to radical centrism (like me)
@a_centrism @lesliedouglasx What, exactly, is "serious culture?"
@a_centrism You mean Marvel isn't "life affirming" and stolid and heroic and boilerplate?
@a_centrism @aaronsibarium @bariweiss Our elite universities are overrated.
@VaughnPoliH @AllenRob00 @alexi @axios How’s that centrism going for abortion rights?
@a_centrism Black children of African parents, do equally well or better than white children.
@a_centrism Would never have suspected this
@a_centrism This is nuts 🤯
@a_centrism Illinois and Colorado are about to be the only islands of blue where anyone can get an abortion between the coasts
@a_centrism How about you slice not by race but income quintile?
@EAweblog @a_centrism @TheRabbitHole84 @AndrewYang Ireland and Denmark are both less than 2% non white. That's why I used those examples.
@tomfromtheweb It's just absolutely wild how American left 'extremism' is the world's centrism.
@BThedeceiver @a_centrism It didn’t. He compared US whites to all groups in those countries.
@a_centrism That's because they collectively possess zero value.
@reachjulieroys @Acts29 @MattChandler74 @PastorMark Classic enlightened centrism at the expense of common sense and justice.
@a_centrism Men who birth need access to compete in high school girls track cause equity.
@a_centrism @ExtravertedFace @AF_Graphs Frank Lloyd Wright
@a_centrism @clairlemon Yes. The original tweet is unsound.
@QuestforOrion @a_centrism Ok, then you believe it starts at conception. Why?
@a_centrism @aaronsibarium @bariweiss Does Yale Law still have the highest LSAT scores in the country?
@xghostnotesx Vote so hard centrism stops being stagnant
@a_centrism Like overturn a court ruling that sends decision back to the states?
@aaronsibarium @bariweiss $60,000 a year tuition.
@a_centrism Was the fact you don't know what "kitsch" means one of your points?
@a_centrism modern culture is dominated by the left, and it is also awful
@a_centrism @s_r_tarnmoor, was this you?
@a_centrism @clairlemon Why not both?
@a_centrism Sounds fuckin based
@a_centrism Could you mention like a single good thing cuckservatives oppposed to tho
@a_centrism It’s funny that we just don’t hear about the same level of drama at Harvard.
@a_centrism yale law school grads are fucking terrifying
@a_centrism Considering dislike for freedom of speech the "silence is violence"
@a_centrism @clairlemon I think it takes more than money to raise a child.
@a_centrism I'm a musicologist and I reject your claim. Conservatism = classicism in music and art.
@a_centrism Seems like it’s on the way down if this trend continues (unless the rankings are shit to begin with).
@fake_biden 'EnLigHtEneD CEnTrisM'
@a_centrism they could have saved their parents a lot of money
@a_centrism Never would have expected US to score higher than Scandinavia.
@a_centrism @ZebPackard @clairlemon These people think all men are rapists. It's the o Lu way they can think about this.
@a_centrism @clairlemon Moral degradation takes many forms.
@a_centrism @clairlemon Weren't there a few republicans who did that?
@CallMeXennial @a_centrism @clairlemon It will happen.
This came out as “centrism” I feel hurt
@CallMeXennial @a_centrism @clairlemon If my child was conceived from rape, can the rapist get custody or visitation?
@a_centrism @breezewoodian Reddit tier post.
@a_centrism @breezewoodian You only used one. The ampersands are higher value, as you could cast them and sell them at Hobby Lobby.
@breezewoodian Can we at least salvage the commas?
@ZebPackard @a_centrism @clairlemon This is nonsensical and I think you need to read the tweets again more carefully.
@a_centrism Yes this because we want to help black and Hispanic students while also making public education beholden to parents. Win win.
@AP 🙄 Centrism again.
@EAweblog @TheRabbitHole84 @AndrewYang Yes, it continues to improve.
@a_centrism @TheRabbitHole84 @AndrewYang I agree with everything you just said. On that last bit, GWAS is getting better all the time.
@duckinfantry @a_centrism it's much less than 85% , a lot of immigrants got naturalized, i wrote 4 swedish grandparents for a reason
@Bruidhinn @a_centrism He’s fairly reasonable to me most of the time. Best not require purity in allies against the left.
@a_centrism @cover81 Perhaps Korea should retaliate by administering their test solely to children of Samsung employees
@davidjackson911 @a_centrism @shriekingbrains Unfortunately, those students will tend to produce "bad schools" wherever they go...
@a_centrism @roderickgraham You’re a very, very silly person.
@codesixyard @cover81 The Chinese sample is HIGHLY unrepresentaive. It's just from a few large cities.
@ZebPackard @clairlemon Huh? What do rapists have to do with it?
@EAweblog @TheRabbitHole84 @AndrewYang 9 alleles aren't going to explain the gap.
@edoconn2 @CoreUncommon @a_centrism I think you broke their brain.
@jdiglesias @wrstlrboy03 @a_centrism @mercedesschlapp US SFRs are about $43T currently.
@jonathansmucker Centrism cannot fail, it can only be failed.
@codesixyard @a_centrism What nations are suspiciously high?
@RanceBurkhardt @BowTiedCynic @a_centrism It’s not a prescriptive statement. It is normative as science demonstrates.
@no_one_asked__ @cirrusfn @sn0ttyb0y @vrmage92 @h3h3productions Damn, that's the real centrism right there. 😭
@_AlastairX_ @a_centrism You have to remember US Asians include SE Asians
@Catos_cat @BowTiedCynic @a_centrism you presupposed fetuses were "human beings". But that is the very question and everything hangs on it.
@ditvose @JoeBiden splitting the difference, making Major the Dog president, and calling it Centrism
@DeusMozzarella @a_centrism Absolutely. It's laughable to think there's a constitutional right to gay marriage. It's pure politics.
@TM96886248 @a_centrism @AOC We don't want NO cops we just don't want THESE cops. It's an authoritarian personality cult
@danieljoseph103 @a_centrism To show that people claiming there *is* a solution are frauds, liars, and grifters.
@a_centrism But almost all of those developments are in the wrong direction, so conservatives were right.
@a_centrism @TheRabbitHole84 @AndrewYang I'm not talking about the entire gap, I'm talking about nurture being less important than nature.
@oijfoijefpjgpe @a_centrism You have the point
@a_centrism Double digit IQ!
@vynzbrahreborn Double strawman!
@a_centrism As a Mexican, I agree.
@a_centrism Canada is 11th. I am shame.
@AIexandertz @a_centrism Yeah, it’s a controlled g@¥op from what I gather
@a_centrism Plus, even after all that, we're still beating France.
@a_centrism It would be nice to see it broken down further by race, like Whites in France vs Whites in the US.
@KangTreys @a_centrism Mean PISA score of China increased by 65 points between 2015 and 2018 sounds very fishy
@a_centrism Good job on the reading though
@a_centrism Cool with that, if you are willing to cope with election results if they start resembling mid XXth century Europe.
@a_centrism @primalpoly @FitFounder It doesn’t do a very good job.
@EAweblog @a_centrism No. The good old Westerners don't need such things. Just good rulers and mass graves for populists.
@BRazumem @a_centrism He specified under performance by groups of Americans. To me that means we can try and improve.
@EAweblog @TheRabbitHole84 @AndrewYang What do you mean by a "genetic" explanation?
@TheRabbitHole84 @a_centrism @AndrewYang Any explanation that isn't genetics will make you feel better
@a_centrism Damn US Asians, how can you not beat China, shame
@lituainianach the ideology of american centrism i think
@EfePeMadrileno @a_centrism Black or white, red or brown, we could all use a little eugenics
@Airylawyer @a_centrism Thanks. I, too, am repulsed by Stefan. Maybe one day when I'm high, I'll check it out
@RyanCMullally Chart was created by @Steve_Sailer. He compiled PISA data from 2018. Maybe the PISA website has the data?
@a_centrism you’re being super duper racist today
@EAweblog @a_centrism Don't wanna get banned so quickly ahhhah but it's easy to sniff an answer with a big nose IYKWIM
@QuestforOrion @a_centrism Is masturbation murder?
@EfePeMadrileno @a_centrism Oh do, go on, please
@danieljoseph103 @a_centrism To curb your enthusiasm. To check the facts.
@a_centrism @codesixyard Why is Iceland so low?
@TiggXXX @a_centrism Why is this something that needs to be "fixed"?
@a_centrism Then why bother going on about it endlessly?
@a_centrism Maybe you just have trash taste
@a_centrism I would be interested to see how it fares if you could control like that in France. Alas, it's illegal...
@Pcrawjr @a_centrism Most definitely!
@realStevenWalk Some of these types of schools succeed, some don't. That's all I know.
@a_centrism if this isn’t bait i ?? historically and exceptionally false
@igon_value @a_centrism Absolutely.
@a_centrism Anyways this is silly. There are 4 ideologies to consider, not 2.
@sheologian Centrism is death
@a_centrism Conservative do culture just fine…as critics: system and order. It’s their natural state of being. Eliot, Burke, Ruskin, Scott.
@Pcrawjr @a_centrism Lots of arabs and various other ethnicities as well
@a_centrism Interesting
@realStevenWalk There's probably some selection occurring that's positive.
@a_centrism allow more Asian immigrants in, that will balance it out
@TiggXXX @a_centrism Why do you assume that there is a problem?
@a_centrism I'm sure there are more. These are just a few that came to mind right now without too much effort.
@a_centrism Gifted/slow programs to better match student capabilities
@SpeakingBee @a_centrism We have the best blacks and Latinos folks, truly tremendous blacks and Latinos
@codesixyard PISA correlates with IQ close to 0.90, I think.
@a_centrism @Bruidhinn It’s so bad. Never watch it.
@a_centrism IIRC only 50% of Chinese students are allowed to go to high school, inflating their results
@VeteranGamerUK I won’t stand for the kind of reckless centrism and balance you espouse! Heretic!
@a_centrism @yzilber @primalpoly @FitFounder @bryan_caplan For smart kids, much of what they do in school is waste of time.
@nitrobean1 @a_centrism In football it’s the Jimmys and Joes, not the Xs and Os. All about IQ and family life.
@a_centrism How did this develop over time? Possible that new teaching methods hurt dumb kids more than smart ones?
@philosoreview @primalpoly @a_centrism @FitFounder @bryan_caplan And you disagree with his arguments?
@onetakealways @hlm_haberdasher @a_centrism Just look at his fans
@a_centrism Even late stage abortion is very very rarely a "choice". To say it is is just cultural conditioning in its purest form.
@a_centrism In fairness, France is 8 to 9% black, UK is maybe 4% - so other countries are also having their numbers dragged down.
@a_centrism What’s the fix?
@jonnyhottakes @a_centrism you may not be ready for some of the takes from this account
@a_centrism Hmm, Estonia is doing well in PISA, but I think their GDP is below EU average.
@a_centrism Isn’t it apples to oranges to compare an ethnic group of one country to the totality of another?
@philosoreview @primalpoly @a_centrism @FitFounder @bryan_caplan Have you read it?
@a_centrism Ashkenazi Jews boost the score of white Americans, right?

@spark1emark @Nemtastic1 @a_centrism do u have kids?
@a_centrism Wyndham Lewis would like a word with you.
@a_centrism @primalpoly @FitFounder @bryan_caplan this book of Caplan is a gem. pleasure to read. and very very solid data. very humble too
@a_centrism It is child sacrifice to a cult ideology
@a_centrism @FitFounder Read 'The case against education' by @bryan_caplan
@primalpoly @FitFounder How is it a scam?
@a_centrism Yet the left can't meme...curious.
@a_centrism lol no. The progressives are just better at gatekeeping those industries in order to keep right-wing creators out.
@C_Kavanagh This is the platonic ideal of enlightened centrism.
@a_centrism @NathanSpringuh Why would she? They don't care....stop making it about you and teach colors and shapes.
@roderickgraham No one is using the n-word except black people.
@vanikehuman @a_centrism you’re completely misinterpreting his point lol
@EuropeErects "Far-right centrism" Why did you say centrism twice
@CarlGustavEmil @jessesingal Some real enlightened centrism going on right here.
@a_centrism I watched the clip. It is repulsive.
@a_centrism @Bruidhinn Right. Top Gun, now that's culture.
@jpr_smith @a_centrism how can you read this and walk away with the idea that this is what he’s saying lol
@NathanSpringuh I have no idea what you're trying to say here. Just say it plainly.
@idahodingbat @ben_weeks @Rednik_South_OZ @a_centrism you’re conflating modern political perceptions with the broad “ark” of politics, lol
@a_centrism Joyce is terrible. They were right.
@Bruidhinn If you think Footloose (which I've never seen) is culture, then the jokes on you.
@DavidParr1980 @shiv5468 @MatHempell Standing on a ticket of cute child, cute dog, centrism, e-bikes and shoes. Definite winner
@Nemesis8k @hehefunni1 @ottobrunnerfan @a_centrism You're not wrong though
@ReforgedSwordo @APIrwin2 @a_centrism Italian Futurism and Vorticism were most definitely not conservative
@nroesoroes @a_centrism @Isegoria It wouldn't be so tiresome if it wasn't so predictable
@a_centrism @chipatitijuana Singer explicitly supports infanticide, so at least he's honest about it
@davidsirota Centrism kills.
@NathanSpringuh What's the strawman? I don't strive to be betwix anything.
@a_centrism Lol… how’s the center perfectly betwix the straw men going?
@mcshanestan @GhostOfMarcuse @arch_crimes No. It's bad.
@ottobrunnerfan @a_centrism Omg genius! Conservatards need to be doing more of this!
@2024Hawley @a_centrism fascism is not conservative.
@a_centrism @GhostOfMarcuse @arch_crimes So here’s an example of a Brutalist apartment complex. Is this shining?
@vynzbrahreborn @a_centrism he means the former.
@Nemtastic1 @a_centrism Schools considering the 3 MCAT points worth less than the 0.4 GPA gap.
@idahodingbat @ben_weeks @Rednik_South_OZ @a_centrism this point is true but it has absolutely 0 correlation
@a_centrism The latter.
Looks like the centrism is working 👍
i believe in anarcho-neo-centrism with Nazistic characteristics
@a_centrism I can't help thinking that these very same people are against the death penalty.
@a_centrism women have higher neuroticism, i dont think libs do...
@FelixDiangelo Why would you think Marvel movies or YA novels are culture?
@a_centrism Thanks.
@FelixDiangelo @a_centrism Agreed
@TheOnlyHeem I mean....centrism is the political ideology of the privileged so....
@SKane813 @a_centrism This is why Democrats lose. Hard to justify late term abortions.
@ottobrunnerfan @a_centrism Fountain is good fight me Martin
@a_centrism I see it as the left does culture, the right does civilization.
@BolognaFishMD What's the straw man?
@ottobrunnerfan Groundbreaking.
@a_centrism nice straw man. now try steel man
@a_centrism Probably not a pang of conscience, but more a reluctance to state it clearly.
@a_centrism Roe v Wade was a good compromise.
@a_centrism Liberals got their way and all our modern art is trendy kitsch.
@a_centrism @chipatitijuana Is Peter Singer really fine with killing a newborn baby, I've a hard time to believe that.
@a_centrism In every case it was a progressive woman.
@a_centrism can we call it at 8 weeks thats 2 fuckin months
@a_centrism Then again idk if you could call a lot of these "conservative" but certainly right wing
@ottobrunnerfan Credible
@a_centrism Both extreme positions are wrong but “aborting” babies in the 9th month of pregnancy is pure evil.
@a_centrism @Der_Musikant So did Theodore Bilbo
@chipatitijuana @a_centrism Just because the word "ethic" is in "ethicist" does not mean they're good. Ethicists can advocate for evil.
@MillennialF4lco @dpakman @RepRaskin Because she’s more of the failed centrism that’s dominated these past 2 years
@a_centrism quibble all you like
@a_centrism What and where is this?
@conan_esq And yet definitely interested in making an unsubstantiated claim about the tweet.
Elon is not making the rockets bro, he’s too busy pretending that hate speech is centrism
@a_centrism @phl43 Disgusting
@a_centrism Way too much decency - more likely she was PR conscious.
@a_centrism Not interested in slicing definitions with you, sorry
@forged_george_ @a_centrism Civil rights act, equal pay, surely the legislature has done the occasional good thing
@conan_esq When did I describe any of that as high culture?
@chipatitijuana What ethical good is achieved by killing a human being? This isn't a fetus. This is an infant, A human.
@a_centrism You should have stopped at the first tweet before revealing what you think is high culture.
@a_centrism Why is that a problem? Serious question. Many ethicists support this - Singer being the obvious example.
@a_centrism Bro have you even seen Gray’s Anatomy
@a_centrism Yet if you believe ads, black doctors make up some 50% of the medical workforce!
@stefmowords wow this is down right fucked. Peak centrism
@a_centrism I’m okay with more black doctors if and only if we segregate the healthcare system. Blacks treat blacks, Whites treat Whites.
@Nemtastic1 @arielxpink @a_centrism Who's calling for Communism? 🤣
@DiamondEyesFox Centrism, perhaps, rationalism.
Guys, I think we’re really close to Democratic Centrism working. Please continue to be patient.
@AGFox19 @NBCNews It's from Facing Reality by Charles Murray. The table uses data from Cali AMA.
@a_centrism @NBCNews What is this from? Also thank you for your comments as always.
@a_centrism @sam_caspersen Isn't California like the only state without affirmative action? Not American so could very well be wrong here.
@a_centrism Based on what? Every time gay marriage was an issue it was a W for republicans so why is this any different?
centrism jacket potatoes and light mode are all the same thing
i believe in totalitarian paleo-centrism with Nazistic characteristics
@henrybearcroft @a_centrism I think it just means they like talking too much
centrism: 229
@JeffEKahn Oh good, I thought he was more centrist. I'm all for him being further left.
@dakaner i follow someone who liked this and someone who mocked it. truly, i am an enlightened centrist
@QuadCityPat Tim isn't a centrist. He's gonna run as a quasi populist and he'll probably be successful
@Peter_Fitz They'll go further right, 'stop the steal' etc. Going centrist would lose the oligarch bankroll.
When the now dissolved centrist opposition Democratic Party of Japan was in power (2009–2012), Japan's ranking peaked at 12th.
@josh_hammer Dude you are literally a force for evil. You disliking someone is effectively an endorsement.
@KidInAHoodie @slyweazal @Zach_Team @MomJeans44 @Drea_got_rage Thanks corporate centrist weirdo will do
@Timodc Huh? Witness the Vance win in Ohio...I live in Pa and I am a centrist Dem and was so hoping Dolan would win.
@BillKristol Just like @elonmusk ‘s father’s centrist Republican Party of 30 years ago….
@Travis_Lindsay @TheElephantsKid @KenGardner11 He was a centrist that got left behind?
@Windoctorx Yea, we need more liberal leadership, no more of this middle of the road wishy-washy centrist
@Tangledcopse He sure didn’t want us to think he’s a centrist, though. Not that that changes anything, but still
@jeffbrutlag He's a Centrist; he wasn't ever going to protect abortion rights.
Am I a neo con if I support both Dems and Reps or am I merely a centrist
@BobbyPepperJr @CoconinoDems *centrist democrats Fixed it
@EWErickson @JDVance1 It's not surprising that you root for someone else like you who sold their soul to Trump.
So many cringy takes on both side of the aisle right now. Being a centrist sucks especially in times of extreme polarization.
@sahilkapur @LindaSchoenberg Ryan is tough, a fighter. A centrist. My money is on him

Centrist Dems have resorted to yelling at Susan Sarandon. They are completely useless.
