However, when they looked at the conditions recorded specifically as the cause of death, coronavirus was more common.\nAlthough flu and pneumonia deaths have been relatively low this year, the report found that more people had died of Covid in the first eight months of this year than have ever died of flu or pneumonia in the same period since comparable records began in 1959.\n\nGraphic\n\n\n\nIn the year to 31 August 2020 there were 52,327 deaths in England and Wales involving Covid-19 of which 48,168 (92%) had coronavirus as the underlying cause.\nIn the year to date, one-in-eight deaths (12.4%) in the period to August 2020 were caused by Covid. By comparison just 3.5% of deaths in the same period were caused by pneumonia and just 0.1% were caused by flu.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the period January to August, Covid caused around three times as many deaths as we usually see from influenza and pneumonia. This is despite the fact that Covid was not in widespread circulation until March,\xe2\x80\x9d Prof Andrew Hayward, director of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, told the Guardian.\n\nGraphic\n\n\n\nProf Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh cautioned that the ONS data does not reveal whether the higher death toll is down to a greater number of infections, or Covid being more deadly than flu and pneumonia.\nBut, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe substantially greater number of deaths attributed to Covid-19 does tell us that at the moment, Covid-19 is a greater risk to people than influenza.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHayward said other data sheds light on the matter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot necessarily [see] it from these data, because they do not show the number of infections, but Covid-19 has a much higher case fatality rate than influenza.\xe2\x80\x9d\nKao said part of the reason Covid has caused relatively more deaths may be down to the existence of a flu vaccine \xe2\x80\x93 as yet no vaccine is available for the coronavirus.\nThe number of Covid deaths in the eight months to 31 August is higher than the annual total of flu and pneumonia deaths in any year since 2000, the year in which a widespread flu vaccination was introduced in the UK.\nThe ONS report showed that, of the deaths due to Covid in the year to date, 30% occurred in care homes, almost twice the proportion of care home deaths caused by flu and pneumonia (15.2%).\nThe report does not yet cover September to December 2020 \xe2\x80\x93 a time of year when cases of flu typically rise.\nThe influence of these few months on the overall picture remains to be seen, but Hayward said the measures taken to control Covid would also reduced the transmission of flu, meaning fewer deaths of the latter than over a \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d winter.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is to be expected that Covid will continue to cause considerably more deaths than influenza and pneumonia,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nCoronavirus outbreak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth policy\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\n\nOffice for National Statistics\n\n\n\n\nInfectious diseases\n\n\n\n\nnews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n\n\nUS\n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\n\n\nAsia\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\n\n\nMiddle East\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\n\n\nInequality\n\n\n\n\nGlobal development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\n\nCulture\n\n\n\n\nLifestyle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\nComplaints & corrections\n\n\n\n\nSecureDrop\n\n\n\n\nWork for us\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\n\n\nCookie policy\n\n\n\n\nTerms & conditions\n\n\n\n\nHelp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll topics\n\n\n\n\nAll writers\n\n\n\n\nDigital newspaper archive\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise with us\n\n\n\n\nGuardian Labs\n\n\n\n\nSearch jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The\xa0Guardian\n\n\nAvailable for everyone, funded by readers\n\n\n\nContribute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
