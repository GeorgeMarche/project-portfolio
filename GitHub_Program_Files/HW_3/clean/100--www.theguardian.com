Leitch said it would be left to the environmental health officers of Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s 32 local authorities to define and enforce the regulations.\nThis appeared to contradict Sturgeon\xe2\x80\x99s earlier statement, when she insisted that a \xe2\x80\x9cspecific exemption\xe2\x80\x9d for cafes would be set out in regulations to be published on Friday.\nWith businesses still waiting for clarification from the guidelines, hospitality bodies said that many establishments were still uncertain whether or not they would be expected to close.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay Video\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n2:11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Nicola Sturgeon outlines new Scotland Covid restrictions \xe2\x80\x93 video\n\n\nDescribing the unfolding chaos as \xe2\x80\x9cdysfunctional\xe2\x80\x9d, the chief executive of Scotland Food and Drink, James Withers, said that the problem could have been foreseen had the Scottish government consulted with businesses in advance. \xe2\x80\x9cHad we been approached even on Monday we could have worked through this in time for a Wednesday announcement,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding that it was \xe2\x80\x9calso madness\xe2\x80\x9d that licensed restaurants cannot remain open but not serve alcohol.\nThe Scottish Licensed Trade Association stated plainly that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no such thing as a licensed cafe\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore no definition in law of a cafe versus a restaurant, while leading licensing lawyer Stephen McGowan, of the law firm TLT, called on the Scottish government to offer clarity. \xe2\x80\x9cIf parliament does not define cafe and it is left to local interpretation as is suggested here, then expect absolute carnage across the country. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have one premises shut and the one next door open over the subjective view of a council officer? What a position to be in.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAsked about the distinction between a restaurant and a cafe early on Friday morning, Leitch said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a neat division, but most institutions know which they are. What we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do here is curb hospitality in a way that stops households inter-mixing, particularly in the evening but also sometimes during the day in the central belt. But we want the social isolation exemption - people who use cafes, especially the elderly, singly parents, those with kids who can\xe2\x80\x99t have people in their houses right now, we want them to still see each other, but very, very safely\xe2\x80\x9d.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Scotland, Leitch said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re worried about hospitality, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a neat distinction, most institutions know which they are and if they need help with that local authorities and the regulations today will help\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nScotland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoronavirus outbreak\n\n\n\n\nNicola Sturgeon\n\n\n\n\nFood & drink industry\n\n\n\n\nnews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\n\nUK politics\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\n\nMedia\n\n\n\n\nSociety\n\n\n\n\nLaw\n\n\n\n\nScotland\n\n\n\n\nWales\n\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\n\nCulture\n\n\n\n\nLifestyle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\nComplaints & corrections\n\n\n\n\nSecureDrop\n\n\n\n\nWork for us\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\n\n\nCookie policy\n\n\n\n\nTerms & conditions\n\n\n\n\nHelp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll topics\n\n\n\n\nAll writers\n\n\n\n\nDigital newspaper archive\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise with us\n\n\n\n\nGuardian Labs\n\n\n\n\nSearch jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The\xa0Guardian\n\n\nAvailable for everyone, funded by readers\n\n\n\nContribute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
