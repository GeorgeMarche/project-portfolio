On Thursday, the Trust said 782 people had taken voluntary redundancy and 514 people would be made compulsorily redundant after the biggest redundancy consultation process in its 125-year history.\nMore than 14,500 pieces of feedback were received and the Trust said it had listened.\nThere had been particular disquiet at plans to sack education officers. The Trust now says it will retain roles focused on helping children learn and keep curation specialists and everyday maintenance jobs.\nHilary McGrady, the Trust\xe2\x80\x99s director general, thanked staff, volunteers and members for making their views known and said the plans were putting the charity on course for a secure financial future.\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s with deep sadness that we have to make redundancies. I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to stop any of the extraordinary work done by the people of the National Trust.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut our consultation has done as intended. It provided proposals to reach our savings target, and sparked such thorough feedback and collective intelligence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to adapt our plans while still making the savings we needed. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a difficult process with some very hard choices.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMike Clancy, the general secretary of the union Prospect, said: \xe2\x80\x9cProspect understand the pressures the National Trust is under, but this is still a huge number of job losses and those redundancies will have a huge impact on the lives of all affected.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe long-term prospects for the National Trust and access to its properties and lands are hugely important both to employees and to the cultural health of the nation. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe current plan, while devastating for those who are losing jobs they love, is a reasonable way to move forward, minimising job losses while hopefully safeguarding the National Trust\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nThe National Trust\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeritage\n\n\n\n\nCoronavirus outbreak\n\n\n\n\nVoluntary sector\n\n\n\n\nCharities\n\n\n\n\nJob losses\n\n\n\n\nnews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmore on this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Trust denies dumbing down in drive for 'new audiences'\n\n\n\nPlans to cut back expert staff, put treasures in storage and develop \xe2\x80\x98more active, fun and useful experiences\xe2\x80\x99 draw fury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished: 22 Aug 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Trust denies dumbing down in drive for 'new audiences'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDover clifftops 'buzzing with wildlife' after National Trust takeover\n\n\n\nRestoration work and wet winter have led to an explosion of colour and an increase in birds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished: 4 Jul 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nDover clifftops 'buzzing with wildlife' after National Trust takeover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWildfires caused by barbecues harming wildlife, says National Trust\n\n\n\nDry conditions following low spring rainfall have contributed to a rise in fires\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished: 16 Jun 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nWildfires caused by barbecues harming wildlife, says National Trust\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish countryside 'at risk from Boris Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s planning revolution'\n\n\n\nThe prime minister\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98build, build, build\xe2\x80\x99 strategy could harm habitats and reduce wildlife protection, critics warn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished: 4 Jul 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish countryside 'at risk from Boris Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s planning revolution'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Trust hastens projects exposing links of country houses to slavery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished: 22 Jun 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Trust hastens projects exposing links of country houses to slavery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to a third of National Trust's historic homes have slave trade links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished: 15 Aug 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to a third of National Trust's historic homes have slave trade links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Trust begins phased reopening of gardens and parklands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished: 28 May 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Trust begins phased reopening of gardens and parklands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRare UK wildlife thriving in lockdown, reveals National Trust\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished: 19 May 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nRare UK wildlife thriving in lockdown, reveals National Trust\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore more on this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\n\nUK politics\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\n\nMedia\n\n\n\n\nSociety\n\n\n\n\nLaw\n\n\n\n\nScotland\n\n\n\n\nWales\n\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\n\nCulture\n\n\n\n\nLifestyle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\nComplaints & corrections\n\n\n\n\nSecureDrop\n\n\n\n\nWork for us\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\n\n\nCookie policy\n\n\n\n\nTerms & conditions\n\n\n\n\nHelp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll topics\n\n\n\n\nAll writers\n\n\n\n\nDigital newspaper archive\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise with us\n\n\n\n\nGuardian Labs\n\n\n\n\nSearch jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The\xa0Guardian\n\n\nAvailable for everyone, funded by readers\n\n\n\nContribute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
