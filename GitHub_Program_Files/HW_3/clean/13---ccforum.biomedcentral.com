Critical Care aims to improve the care of critically ill patients by acquiring, discussing, distributing, and promoting evidence-based information relevant to intensivists. Critical Care aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the intensive care field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOCTOBER EDITOR\'S PICK\n\nMany COVID-19 patients evolve to ARDS, characterized by profound hypoxemia and an associated high mortality rate.\xa0High-flow nasal oxygen therapy is effective in decreasing the need for endotracheal intubation.
