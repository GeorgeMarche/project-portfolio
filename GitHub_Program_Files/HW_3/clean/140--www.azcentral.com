Why that's a dire errorBill GoodykoontzArizona RepublicView Comments Deadline, an entertainment industry publication, published a startling headline on Thursday afternoon: \xe2\x80\x9cVice President Mike Pence tests positive for Covonvirus 8 days after Donald Trump.\xe2\x80\x9dOne problem, and it's a big one: There\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence that he did.Holy cow. As if the fake-news crowd needs more fodder to trash legitimate journalism.\xc2\xa0The story was obviously published at least prematurely, if not erroneously; the headline included\xc2\xa0a note that read, \xe2\x80\x9cPREP. DO NOT PUBLISH UNTIL THE NEWS CROSSES.\xe2\x80\x9dEventually, Deadline took the story down \xe2\x80\x94 but not before it had remained online, easily found by Google search, for a half-hour or more.'It never should have been posted'\xe2\x80\x9cA draft post of a story about Vice President Mike Pence testing positive for coronavirus that was never meant to publish was accidentally posted on\xc2\xa0Deadline,\xe2\x80\x9d the publication said in a story posted Thursday afternoon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was pulled down immediately. It never should have been posted and Deadline will take steps to see this kind of thing never happens again. Apologies to the Vice President and our readers. We regret the error.\xe2\x80\x9dI would think.Look, mistakes happen. Every media site prepares stories in advance, just in case. We write the tops of stories early, before events begin, so that we can add more details later \xe2\x80\x94 and change the top when needed. We write obituaries of people who are still alive. All this helps us respond to news events as quickly as we can after they happen.Key words: after they happen.Which makes you wonder how it did happen. Deadline didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to a request for comment.This error has consequences for news mediaA mistake like this could not come at a worse time for legitimate journalism. Constantly under attack by President Donald Trump as the \xe2\x80\x9cenemy of the people,\xe2\x80\x9d all media must act responsibly. Fake news has had its meaning twisted. Trump and his supporters use it as a rallying cry, taking\xc2\xa0it to mean any accurate news or coverage that they don\xe2\x80\x99t like, or that they disagree with.That\xe2\x80\x99s not what fake news is. Fake news is news that is, as the name suggests, fake. Stories that aren\xe2\x80\x99t true, in other words.Like the Deadline story.Again, mistakes happen. Legitimate media corrects them, as Deadline did.But some mistakes go deeper, cause more damage, strike more of a blow against the public trust.This is one of them.'Antebellum' has a setup 'Get Out' fans might love. But in the end, it doesn't measure up  'Judgment with Ashleigh Banfield' rehashes the Jodi Arias trial.
