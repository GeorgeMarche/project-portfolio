Maybe not.\xe2\x80\x9cThe way that I see native now, especially in America, it is still a very central and important part of any direct offering brought to an advertiser,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThe reason being [that] if you have an interest in telling a story organically with certain key tenets of your own proprietary messages, you really have to partner with a studio like Foundry to get that message the way you want it.\xe2\x80\x9dFoundry, Meredith\xe2\x80\x99s branded content shop which Roth heads, has a staff of 75 working across 40 editorial brands \xe2\x80\x93 and the pressure is on after the magazine publisher, and owner of titles including People, Better Homes & Gardens and Food & Wine, announced plans to cut 180 jobs after registering a $234 million loss in the 12 months to 30 June.But Roth has put in place a three-step plan\xc2\xac to ensure the content Foundry produces for brands is suitable for the times, both in terms of production restrictions and audience preferences.One of these is to understand how, in the context of COVID-19, branded content marketers, accustomed to a certain level of funding often not granted to their editorial counterparts, must readjust their expectations. So, no more flying off to exotic locations to shoot a 90-second mini documentary. Instead, Roth is \xe2\x80\x9cleaning in\xe2\x80\x9d to familiar formats, but with a new approach. Take influencer marketing: not only do advertisers require a \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling story\xe2\x80\x9d from their content creators, but more than likely they will need them to be capable of shooting that content themselves.Clients are strongly encouraged to join virtual production shoots, so they can \xe2\x80\x9cparticipate in shot-by-shot decision-making\xe2\x80\x9d, and Roth believes this arms-length approach is resulting in a more \xe2\x80\x9cauthentic\xe2\x80\x9d quality of content.\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s been so reassuring for us is that the content we\xe2\x80\x99ve produced over the last six to eight months has felt extremely authentic and organic. You actually get more comfortable talent experiences when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a giant production team standing behind a camera,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.For more on the future of branded content, read WARC\xe2\x80\x99s report: Meredith finds a new role for branded content during COVID-19.\nSourced from WARC\n\n\n\n\nSign up for daily news\n\n\nLatest\n\n\nOpinion\n Experience is more than just the next theme of your ad campaign\n\n\nNews\n Why brands need to put Black Lives Matter in context\n\n\nNews\n Brand Friction: The key to unlocking the complexities of customer experience\n\n\nNews\n Chinese retailer Shein finds favour with American teens\n\n\nNews\n The 5 'Frontier CMO' strategies to lead brands to economic recovery\n\n\nNews\n Three details on Amazon Halo illuminate the giant\xe2\x80\x99s theory of success\n\n\nOpinion\n Hidden Figures: A look at Black British marketing and design\n\n\nNews\n US brands adopt e-commerce livestreaming to boost sales\n\n\nView more News and Opinion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor WARC Subscribers only\nWhat do I get from a WARC subscription?\n\n\n\n\nVox Media finds success with \xe2\x80\x98Explainer\xe2\x80\x99 branded content during COVID-19\n\nVox Media, the US digital media publisher, changed approach to deliver branded content projects during the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\n\nWhat we know about brand partnerships\n\nProvides guidance and reading on a now common aspect of brand building \xe2\x80\x93 partnerships \xe2\x80\x93 in which two or more brands collaborate for mutual benefit.\n\n\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s working in content marketing\n\nGlobal strategies, campaign updates and trends in content marketing.\n\n\n\n\nGet a demo or Sign in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Topics\n            \n\n\n\nMedia & publishing (general)\nUnited States\nNative advertising & advertorial\nBrand-funded entertainment\nContent marketing \nBrand partnerships\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPlease enter your feedback.\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\nSend feedback\n\n\n\nwww.warc.com\n\xa9 Copyright 2020\nAll rights reserved including database rights.
