Many citizens want first dibs on new jabs tooGraphic detailOct 8th 2020FacebookTwitterLinkedInWhatsAppEditor\xe2\x80\x99s note (October 9th 2020): This article has been updated since it was first published.WHEN IT COMES to developing a vaccine for the coronavirus, some countries have decided to go it alone. Last month, the Trump administration said it would not participate in Covax, an alliance of more than 150 countries backed by the World Health Organisation formed to develop and distribute a covid-19 vaccine. Russia too has opted out. (China, which had also stayed out, said on October 9th that it would join in.) Such \xe2\x80\x9cvaccine nationalism\xe2\x80\x9d is counterproductive, according to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO\xe2\x80\x99s director-general. Eradicating the virus in some countries, while allowing it to fester in others, would only prolong the pandemic.But according to a new survey, plenty of people think that, when a vaccine does arrive, their country should get it first. Between March and September, researchers from the United Nations and the International Security and Development Centre, a research group in Berlin, polled some 11,600 people from 137 countries about their experience with covid-19. One of the questions asked how a vaccine should be distributed. Although a plurality of respondents said it should be divvied up equally around the world, one in three said they would prefer that their own country have preferential access (the rest said countries with the highest infection rates should get priority).Such selfish views were surprisingly common. In Brazil, Finland and Portugal, over 40% of respondents said they wanted special access. In America, a whopping 46% said they wanted first dibs on a vaccine; just 41% said it should be made available worldwide (see chart). Indeed, of the countries with at least 150 survey responses, the United States was the only one whose residents preferred the selfish answer to either of the other options. Germany, by contrast, was the most egalitarian, with 69% of respondents preferring to share the vaccine equally.No matter who develops an effective vaccine first, those clamouring for it may be disappointed. Although Donald Trump has brashly promised to manufacture enough doses for every American by April, the head of Britain\xe2\x80\x99s vaccine task-force warned this week that only 30m people\xe2\x80\x94about half the population\xe2\x80\x94might be vaccinated. (Eventually, the government hopes to achieve 75-100%). The WHO has proposed an even more miserly distribution. It envisages that just 3% of the population of each country would receive a jab at first, enough to cover front-line workers such as doctors and nurses.Only later would members of the public at high risk of the disease, such as old people, be immunised\xe2\x80\x94around 20% of the population. After that vaccines would be allocated to countries based on how fast the virus is spreading and how well health-care systems are coping. All over the world, and especially in America, people will bristle at having to wait their turn.Reuse this contentThe Trust ProjectMore from Graphic detailDaily chartThe world economy will suffer from \xe2\x80\x9clong covid\xe2\x80\x9d tooDaily chartAmy Coney Barrett is the least popular Supreme Court nominee in recent historyWeb of distrustFaith in government declines when mobile internet arrivesThe best of our journalism, hand-picked each daySign up to our free daily newsletter, The Economist todaySign up nowSubscribeGroup subscriptionsHelpKeep updatedFacebookInstagramTwitterLinkedInYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in \xe2\x80\x9ca severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.\xe2\x80\x9d The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupThe Economist Intelligence UnitThe Economist StoreCareersWhich MBA?GMAT TutorGRE TutorExecutive JobsExecutive Education NavigatorTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCopyright \xc2\xa9 The Economist Newspaper Limited 2020.
