The editors point to the death rate in the US, which is more than double that of Canada and exceeds that of Japan, whilst also being ahead of lower-middle-income countries, such as Vietnam, by a factor of almost 2000.The authors also criticise nearly every step the US has taken to combat the pandemic, noting that while the absolute numbers of tests have substantially increased, the number of tests performed per infected person puts the country below others such as Kazakhstan, Zimbabwe and Ethiopia. The editors say that although the US government has "appropriately invested heavily" in vaccine development, its "rhetoric has politicised the development process and led to growing public distrust."Further, the NEJM editors criticise "dramatic" testing and policy failures at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), whilst noting that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been excluded from "much crucial government decision making." The authors conclude "when it comes to the response to the largest public health crisis of our time, our current political leaders have demonstrated that they are dangerously incompetent. We should not abet them and enable the deaths of thousands more Americans by allowing them to keep their jobs."Do you agree or disagree with the NEJM editorial?
