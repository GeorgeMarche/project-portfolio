I understand it\xe2\x80\x99s a sensitive topic, but that is the truth \xe2\x80\x93 period. You want to solve the problem? Acknowledge the problem,\xe2\x80\x9d Cuomo said during a news conference Tuesday.\n\nCuomo said he consulted with ultra-Orthodox Jewish leaders before the measures were imposed. \xe2\x80\x9cI asked for them to work with me to follow these guidelines and that was positively received,\xe2\x80\x9d he told reporters.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said to them that I\xe2\x80\x99m doing this for a very simple reason: because I have such respect and love for the Orthodox community.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHowever, the new restrictions sparked criticism from many ultra-Orthodox community members, hundreds of whom protested in Borough Park, a neighbourhood of Brooklyn, on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you need to wear a mask. I understand you social distance. What bothers me is: You pick on the good people,\xe2\x80\x9d Brooklyn resident Meir Nimni told the Associated Press news agency on Wednesday.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody here wants to live, and everybody cares\xe2\x80\x9d about stopping the novel coronavirus, Nimni said. But he saw a double standard that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjust not fair\xe2\x80\x9d.\nLocal and state legislators also slammed the executive order, accusing Cuomo of singling out the ultra-Orthodox community without cause.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis language was dangerous and divisive, and left the implication that Orthodox Jews alone are responsible for rising COVID cases in New York State,\xe2\x80\x9d the legislators wrote in an open letter. \xe2\x80\x9cThis implication is not born out by the state\xe2\x80\x99s own data.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Governor is wrong, and he knows he's wrong.\nMy statement with @NYSenatorFelder, Assemblyman @SEichenstein & Councilman @ChaimDeutsch. pic.twitter.com/X7vGAZNUXN\n\xe2\x80\x94 Kalman Yeger \xd7\x95\xd7\xa0\xd7\xa9\xd7\x9e\xd7\xa8\xd7\xaa\xd7\x9d \xd7\x9e\xd7\x90\xd7\x93 \xd7\x9c\xd7\xa0\xd7\xa4\xd7\xa9\xd7\x95\xd7\xaa\xd7\x99\xd7\x9b\xd7\x9d (@KalmanYeger) October 7, 2020\n\nNew York state reported 1,836 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, the health department reported.
