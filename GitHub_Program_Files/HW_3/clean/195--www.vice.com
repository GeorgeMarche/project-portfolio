This came after warnings from health officials that cases of COVID-19 in the UK were rising rapidly among 17 to 29-year-olds, and that young people are the group most likely to spread the virus.\nIn an interview for LBC, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock expressed his concern at the steep rise. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are concerned about the number of cases we've seen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe rise is predominantly among younger people... but young people can infect their grandparents.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWorld NewsA Brief Timeline of the UK Government\xe2\x80\x99s Contradictory Coronavirus Messaging James O'Malley09.23.20Since then, COVID-19 case modelling has shown that the UK could face 50,000 daily cases by October (dwarfing the current number of around 4,000 daily cases) if the government does not take further action to curb the spread. But recent claims that the sharp uptick in cases specifically across parts of northern England has been largely due to the irresponsible actions of young people has caused a backlash. To what extent should the blame for this rise be placed at the door of Britain\xe2\x80\x99s youth?\nThe Asymptomatic Generation\nAlthough hospital admissions and deaths across the UK and many parts of Europe have decreased since the initial first waves, cases have been steadily rising. Of all age groups, cases testing positive have been highest amongst those aged 17 to 24 and 25 to 34 years, while groups above the age of 50 have been declining, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nPreliminary studies by the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, Italy, suggest that over 80 percent of all people under the age of 20 with coronavirus show no symptoms. This means that potentially a large population of young people around the world are unwittingly carrying and transmitting the disease. Back in June (when lockdowns were starting to be lifted), the WHO created confusion by stating that asymptomatic people are less likely to spread the virus, because they were less likely to be coughing and therefore spreading their infected droplets. This claim was reversed, but Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO\xe2\x80\x99s technical lead on the COVID-19 pandemic, later stated that the actual rates of transmission by asymptomatic people are not yet fully known.\nHouse Parties and Pub Crawls\nA good case study is Bolton, a borough of Greater Manchester, where cases are rising fastest (with 90 percent of all cases coming from 18 to 49-year-olds), and stories have surfaced of young people flouting the rules. A local 23-year-old man who returned from holidaying in Ibiza, Spain, after quarantine restrictions were imposed did not self-isolate. Instead, he held a house party, in addition to going out several times, and was later fined \xc2\xa31,000. Another person has been thought to have infected more than 17 other people attending a pub crawl while contagious.\nThis behaviour isn\xe2\x80\x99t new. Earlier this year, police in Greater Manchester were called out nearly 500 times to shut down gatherings in a four-day period in April. Young people in Leeds have also been urged to stay vigilant after seven \xc2\xa310,000 fines had been issued to rave organisers.\nSo, are young people to blame? Or are these headline-grabbing stories unrepresentative of something much more complex? A leaked report from Public Health England showed that nine out of ten boroughs in Greater Manchester never actually left the epidemic phase, and that the national lockdown did little to curb the spread of the virus in those areas. Lockdown relaxed in England on the 23rd June 2020, when London\xe2\x80\x99s seven-day case average was 43.7, while the North West of England had a seven-day average of 127.4.\nAndy Burnham, the elected mayor of Greater Manchester said in a piece for the Financial Times that COVID-19 in Manchester is \xe2\x80\x9cendemic\xe2\x80\x9d. He blamed the lifting of lockdown as being timed with what was convenient against London\xe2\x80\x99s transmission rates, as opposed to other areas of the UK. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were left with a higher level of underlying virus,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce summer came and people started to mix again \xe2\x80\x93 especially those in their 20s and 30s who generally do not display symptoms of the disease \xe2\x80\x93 the virus spread.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHealth 'Why Do I Always Want to Bail on Plans With My Friends?'Gina Tomaine09.22.20Greater Manchester includes some of the most impoverished neighbourhoods in the country, highest rates of underlying health conditions, a large BAME community and high-density housing, which has led to backlash about pointing the finger at young people instead of providing the support those areas needed.\nThe Blame Game\nOn the 11th of September, two pubs \xe2\x80\x93 The Oddfellows Arms in Sherburn-in-Elmet, North Yorkshire, and The Angel Inn in Sheffield \xe2\x80\x93 banned service to young people, refusing to serve anyone aged between 18 and 25, showing just how compelling this narrative that young people are to blame has become across Northern England.\nJohn Ashton, British public health director and author of Blinded by Corona: How the Pandemic Ruined Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Health and Wealth and What to Do About It, thinks this narrative is incorrect. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s outrageous to blame people for doing what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been told to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were told to go out and shop, shop, shop and eat, eat, eat to keep the economy going. What the government should have been doing is enabling the workforce \xe2\x80\x93 which includes young people \xe2\x80\x93 to carry on more or less normally. If they\xe2\x80\x99d been regularly tested and adhered to personal hygiene, mask wearing and social distancing, then this wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happening.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDespite the concern about the uptick in cases, there were reports last week that COVID-19 tests were available in only two of England\xe2\x80\x99s top 48 hotspots  \xe2\x80\x93 including the Greater Manchester boroughs \xe2\x80\x93 just as new restrictions prohibiting social gatherings of more than six people have been put into place. Is this the government\xe2\x80\x99s way of covering its tracks for when students go back to university in just a few weeks? \n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wrong to pick out the young people and blame them,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ashton. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been let down and I think the big challenge is going to be when the students go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n@sabfaramarzi\nTagged:young peoplenorthern englandpandemicworldnewsworld coronavirusGet a personalized roundup of VICE's best stories in your inbox.SubscribeBy signing up to the VICE newsletter you agree to receive electronic communications from VICE that may sometimes include advertisements or sponsored content.AdvertisementAbout JobsPartnerVICE VoicesContent Funding on VICESecurity PolicyPrivacy & Terms\xc2\xa9 2020 VICE MEDIA GROUP"
