With the delayed NHS Covid contact tracing app slated to launch later this week, Billy Palmer takes another look at the pipeline of the test and trace programme, and finds a system still weighed down by inefficiencies and uncertainties throughout the process.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Data story\n    \n\n            Published: 22/09/2020\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Author\n                    \n\nBilly Palmer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NHS Test and Trace programme forms a central part of the government\xe2\x80\x99s coronavirus recovery strategy. More than three months after the programme commenced in England in May, we\xe2\x80\x99ve pieced together the data to look at the extent to which the issues we\xc2\xa0previously\xc2\xa0identified have been resolved.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve found a system that is still far from water-tight, with leakages all the way along the pipeline \xe2\x80\x93 from the numbers of people referred to the Test and Trace programme right through to those being told to self-isolate.\n\nIt is likely that large numbers of infected people are being missed. Although 15,526 people were \xe2\x80\x98transferred\xe2\x80\x99 to NHS Test and Trace in the week to 9 September, during that period a higher number \xe2\x80\x93 18,371 \xe2\x80\x93 tested positive. And the estimated number of new infections in the community was somewhere in the region of 59,800 over a similar timeframe.\nBut of those transferred, around one in six (2,424) could not be contacted and 271 had no contact details.\nOf the 12,831 infected people who were reached, around one in six again could not provide recent close contacts. And where contacts were provided, fewer than three-quarters (74%) were reached and asked to self-isolate.\nCrucially, of those people then asked to self-isolate (12,831 positive cases and 45,653 recent close contacts in the last week), there is still no information available on how many have done so. A previous estimate from the government\xe2\x80\x99s own Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) suggests fewer than one in five might be fully adherent to self-isolation and quarantine.\n\nSince its launch, the system has delivered some improvements and in this latest week has had to deal with a substantial increase in cases. However, the latest data also show people are waiting longer to receive a test result. There also remain some key unknowns, such as whether the recent close contacts provided by each infected person is comprehensive. We will have to wait and see whether the long-awaited app \xe2\x80\x93 due to be released on Thursday this week\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 helps in this regard.\nOf course, it is unrealistic to expect a perfectly performing programme \xe2\x80\x93 other countries are struggling with contact tracing too. But it is also clear that the system continues to fall short of what is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n                        \n        The leaky pipeline of the test and trace programme\n    \n\n                \n                            \n                \n        \n                                                                \n                    22/09/2020\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n                        \n                                    Chart\n                \n            \n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Note: \xa0\n                        \n\n1.
