This was FAO\xe2\x80\x99s main message at the opening of the High-Level Special Event on Strengthening Global Governance of Food Security and Nutrition.\n\n\n\n\n13/10/2020\nImpact of COVID-19 on people's livelihoods, their health and our food systems\nMillions of agricultural workers - waged and self-employed - while feeding the world, regularly face high levels of working poverty, malnutrition and poor health, and suffer from a lack of safety and labour protection as well as other types of abuse. With low and irregular incomes and a lack of social support, many of them are spurred to continue working, often in unsafe conditions, thus exposing themselves and their families to additional risks.\n\n\nSEE MORE NEWS >\n\n\n\nMedia contacts chevron_rightTweets by FAOnews \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOLLOW US ON\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAO organizational chart\n\n\nWorldwide Offices\nRegional Office for AfricaRegional Office for Asia and the PacificRegional Office for Europe and Central AsiaRegional Office for Latin America and the CaribbeanRegional Office for the Near East and North AfricaCountry Offices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJobsContact usTerms and ConditionsScam AlertReport Misconduct\nDownload our App\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa9 FAO\xa02020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
