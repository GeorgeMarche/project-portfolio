Since MERS infects camels, I was concerned about what would happen if my horse could get it?! Horses have massive lungs and a sensitive respiratory system, and we humans often touch their noses and mouths.\nBrown and her team began their work by applying a mix of genetic sequence alignment and structural analysis of the receptor protein for the\xc2\xa0virus \xe2\x80\x93ACE2 \xe2\x80\x94 to a range of species known to be either susceptible or resistant to COVID-19. This revealed five amino acid sites within the protein that affect an animal\xe2\x80\x98s level of vulnerability.\nThe team used these sites to develop an algorithm that predicts the susceptibility of other species by analyzing their ACE2 sequences.\n[Read:\xc2\xa0This AI spots local COVID-19 outbreaks before they\xe2\x80\x99ve spun out of control]\nAs well as horses and camels, the algorithm found that\xc2\xa0the Chinese horseshoe bat has a high risk of catching the virus. It\xc2\xa0also gave intermediate susceptibility scores to the Malayan pangolin, cow, goat, and sheep.\nThe researchers believe these findings can help protect people, wildlife, livestock, and food sources from COVID-19. They also think their approach could be applied to other viruses or during future outbreaks.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is also the opportunity to investigate if the identified five sites on ACE2 that most distinguish susceptible from non-susceptible species can be used as targets to develop drugs that inhibit these sites specifically,\xe2\x80\x9d added\xc2\xa0Meena Madhur, the associate director of the Vanderbilt Institute for Infection, Immunology, and Inflammation.\nThe team has now made their algorithm public on a website, where anyone can upload\xc2\xa0ACE2 sequences of animals\xc2\xa0to generate their COVID-19 susceptibility score.\n\n                                    Published October 7, 2020  18:19 UTC\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Macaulay\n\n                                        October 7, 2020  18:19 UTC\n                                    \n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost popular\n\n\n\n\nAI helps produce world\xe2\x80\x99s largest 3D map of the universe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Heart of Tech\n\n\n\n\nMore TNW\n\nNews\nEvents\nEnterprise\nIntelligence\nAnswers\nSpaces\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout TNW\n\nAbout\nAdvertise\nJobs\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay tuned\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly\n\n\n\nDaily\n\n\n\nBreaking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \xa9 20062020.\nAll rights reserved.\nMade with <3 in Amsterdam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
