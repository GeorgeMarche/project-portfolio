She told us now is not the time to relax on the CDC guidelines to protect your family.\nIts frightening because there are so many people that lost their lives to it, Heitmann said.\nShe says the scariest thing about having COVID-19 is the possibility of putting others in danger.\nWe had gone out with my mother-in-law for a fishing trip. She turned 87, she said.\nAnd when the mayor found out her daughter, who was also on the trip, had coronavirus, I immediately called Chief DiMaria and he immediately went into action and he immediately send me to advanced health, she explained.\nHeitmanns first test came back negative, but a second result showed she was positive for COVID-19, despite masking up except when outdoors.\nI was really careful, she said. I mean, Ive been wearing my mask and I had no idea I would catch it.\nHeitmanns mother-in-law managed to escape the virus. Right now, the mayor is conducting business for City Hall while quarantining at home with mild symptoms.\nYou hurt. Your body throbs and I wasnt short of breath, but i could tell my breathing was different, she said of her symptoms.\nHaving the virus hasnt changed Heitmanns view on how the city of Naples handled the pandemic for stores and restaurants.\nTheyve all required masks so Im very proud that they took the responsibility and the respect for our community upon themselves and they didnt have to have a law that was imposed upon them, she said.\nTwo city workers who were around the mayor quarantined but tested negative. they will be allowed to return to work in person Friday.\nHeitmann hopes to be back at work on the 14th but will need two negative test results.\nShe wants to thank the community for their kindness and support.\n\nReporter:Gina TomlinsonWriter:Briana Harvath \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDo you see a typo or an error?
