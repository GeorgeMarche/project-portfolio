collections have been implemented to support incident management. The collections were activated at short notice and the content of the collections has evolved as the incident has developed.\xc2\xa0 The data collected is classified as management information. It has been collected on a daily basis with a tight turn round time.\xc2\xa0 No revisions have been made to the dataset. Any analysis of the data should be undertaken with this in mind.\nThe publication covers\n\n\n\n\n\nthe number of patients in hospital with COVID including those in mechanical ventilation\nthe number of patients admitted to hospital with COVID\nthe number of patients diagnosed in hospital with COVID\nthe number of patients discharged from hospital\nstaffing absences\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the data is collected on a daily basis, and this publication is updated monthly. Next publication: Thursday 12 November\nThis monthly publication file now provides a trust level breakdown of the five admission indicators which are provided at regional and national level each day on this page of our website. The admission indicators have been published daily since 22nd September and contain a time series which starts on 1st August and that time series is added to each day with the release of data. The indicators are derived from various data components within the daily Covid sitrep and the data for these components was deemed to be of sufficient quality from the beginning of August for such indicator construction.\nPublication Definitions (PDF, 124KB)\nOctober 2020 COVID Publication (XLS, 5.60MB)\nPlease note that from September 2020 onwards, publication of the COVID hospital time series now includes data from Independent Sector Mental Health Learning Disability and Autism (IS MHLDA) providers, which had previously been excluded due to data quality concerns.
