Younger children were reported at low levels  but with young children likely to be asymptomatic in a vast majority of cases and testing only being done on symptomatic children  and in a huge number of cases not even then  the real numbers of younger children affected is likely to rival the high rate among their older siblings.\nThe numbers show beyond reasonable doubt that schools and universities are the main driver of the second wave  as even the governments own scientists warned. Yet the Tories continue to pursue the hospitality industry as if that was the engine room of the pandemic and are obstinately refusing to even consider calls for schools to be closed again.\nAs long as they continue to do so, no efforts to get on top of the second wave have a hope of success.\nThe SKWAWKBOX needs your help.
