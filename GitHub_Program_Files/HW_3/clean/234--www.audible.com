She was raised by her Newark-tough single mom, Teri, a woman who loved the world of show business and was often a media sensation all by herself. Brooke\'s iconic modeling career began by chance when she was only 11 months old, and Teri\'s skills as both Brooke\'s mother and her manager were formidable. But in private she was troubled and drank heavily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n                            Wow - a heart touching listen!\n                        \n\n\n    \n                        By\n                        \n \n\n  \nDawn F Horner\n                          on  \n                        11-20-14\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\nThere Was a Little Girl\n\n    \n                        By:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n            \n        \n        Brooke Shields\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheech Is Not My Real Name\n\n\n    \n                        ...But Don\'t Call Me Chong\n                    \n\n\n    \n                        By:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n        Cheech Marin\n    \n    \n\n\n                    \n\n\n    \n                        Narrated by:\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n        Cheech Marin\n    \n    \n\n\n                    \n\n\n    \n                        Length: 7 hrs and 29 mins\n                    \n\n\n    \n                    Unabridged\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n                            Overall\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n                            362\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n                            Performance\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n                            341\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n                            Story\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n                            340\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n                \n                    \n                        Cheech Marin came of age at an interesting time in America and became a self-made counterculture legend with his other half, Tommy Chong.

Now he\'s opening up for the first time and sharing his behind-the-scenes stories in a warmly endearing, sharply observed, and frankly funny look at life in Hollywood.  In 1986 Jon Cryer won over America as Molly Ringwald\'s loyal and lovable best friend, Duckie, in the cult classic Pretty in Pink, in a role that set the tone for his three-decade-long career in Hollywood. He went on to establish himself as one of the most talented comedic actors in the business, ultimately culminating in his current turn as Alan Harper on the massively popular sitcom Two and a Half Men.  With the instincts of a natural storyteller, Cryer charts his extraordinary journey in show business, illuminating his many triumphs and some missteps along the way. Filled with exclusive behind-the-scenes anecdotes, Cryer offers his own endearing perspective on Hollywood, the business at large, and the art of acting.  Cryer has worked with some of the biggest and most provocative names in the business, and here, for the first time, he details his experiences with Charlie Sheen, John Hughes, Robert Altman, Molly Ringwald, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, and Christopher Reeve, among many others. He shares the intimate details of his friendships and relationships, pays tribute to his mentors, and explores the peculiar combination of heart, talent, and wisdom it takes to survive not just the bad times in a notoriously fickle industry but even the good times.  In this revealing, humorous, and introspective memoir, Cryer offers listeners a front-row seat as he reminisces about his life and experiences in showbiz over the past 30 years. \n\n\n\xc2\xa92015 Jon Cryer (P)2015 Penguin Audio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from the same\n\n\nNarrator\n\n\n\nBreathing Underwater\n\n\nThe Big Nap\n\n\nChet Gecko, Private Eye Volume 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat listeners say about So That Happened\n\nAverage Customer Ratings\n\n\n\nOverall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n            4.5 out of 5.0\n        \n\n\n\n            5 Stars\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            763\n        \n\n\n\n            4 Stars\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            313\n        \n\n\n\n            3 Stars\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            111\n        \n\n\n\n            2 Stars\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            22\n        \n\n\n\n            1 Stars\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            8\n        \n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n            4.7 out of 5.0\n        \n\n\n\n            5 Stars\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            856\n        \n\n\n\n            4 Stars\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            186\n        \n\n\n\n            3 Stars\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            49\n        \n\n\n\n            2 Stars\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            8\n        \n\n\n\n            1 Stars\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            7\n        \n\n\n\n\n\nStory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n            4.4 out of 5.0\n        \n\n\n\n            5 Stars\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            653\n        \n\n\n\n            4 Stars\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            298\n        \n\n\n\n            3 Stars\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            108\n        \n\n\n\n            2 Stars\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            31\n        \n\n\n\n            1 Stars\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            10\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews - Please select the tabs below to change the source of reviews.\n\n\n\n\nAudible.com Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudible.co.uk reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudible.com.au reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSort by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Most Helpful\n\n\n  Most Recent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  All stars\n\n\n  5 star only\n\n\n  4 star only\n\n\n  3 star only\n\n\n  2 star only\n\n\n  1 star only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n                            Overall\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n                                Performance\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n                                Story\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDea Lyn\n\n\n    \n                            04-14-15\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                So much more than just TWO AND A HALF MEN!!!\n            \n\n    \n            Thank you, Jon Cryer, for sharing this with your fans!  As a long time fan of Jon Cryer and Two and a Half Men, I couldn\'t wait to get my hands on this book. I\'ve been on the set many times, met Jon, and have several friends who work on the show, so I thought I knew quite a bit already. But Jon was so open and candid about so much in this memoir that I ended up learning way more than I ever imagined, especially about Jon\'s earlier life. Jon\'s own self-spoken words describing the events in his life up to now make this an excellent choice on Audible. I absolutely loved and appreciated all that he had to say and share.  Jon had a lot to say, but he did it all with honesty, enthusiasm, heart, and class.  Jon, if you read this, I loved your book so much I read it start to finish from the time I got in my LAX-FLL red eye, through my first day at sea on my cruise lol!  But seriously, it is THAT good!

I\'ve never been a  fan of Two and a Half Men, and fortunately this story only spent the time it had to talking about the show and Charlie Sheen, and somehow Mr. Cryer even managed to make that topic interesting news. His writing voice is sincere and honest and peppered with the perfect amount of sarcasm and warranted disrespect. His observations into his world and insights into humanity in general are fresh and totally non-celebrity-ish. And his narration had me roaring out loud in my car. I plan to call my aging and forgetful brain into full action so that in a month or so I\'ll be able to listen to it all again, as if for the first time. Actually it is so good I may actually be OK re- listening without needing to purge my memory! If you\'ve ever suspected that the world is just a giant video game, or even if you haven\'t, you owe it to your brain to enjoy Jon Cryer\'s performance. Bravo! And thanks.\n        \n\n\n    \n                    13 people found this helpful\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n                            Overall\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n                                Performance\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n                                Story\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalaala\n\n\n    \n                            01-08-16\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                i knew he was talented but ...

I enjoyed my 8+ hours with Jon in my car while traveling. I never knew how many movies and how much theatre he was in.  Jon seems to be well grounded with his career and his life.  So happy he gave me 12 seasons of 2 1/2 Men, I loved every episode. The fact that Ashton Kutcher slid right in and show just got better is a tribute to Jon\'s sincere desire to always do his best and work toward the greater good of the show and not his own agenda.  So there Molly Ringwald!  \n        \n\n\n    \n                    3 people found this helpful\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n                            Overall\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n                                Performance\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n                                Story\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nluke\n\n\n    \n                            05-26-15\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                That was a fun ride\n            \n\n    \n            I thoroughly enjoyed this audio book.

Also, obviously, the #WINNING era Charlie Sheen years.

Hes as witty and eloquent as Stephen Fry. I never knew about his theatre background. And I loved the line about Andrew McCarthys hair in Pretty in Pink. He seems to get Showbiz and remain grounded. Just a pity he had to put up with an unprofessional dick like Charlie Sheen for so long on his sitcom. Definitely a great listen!
