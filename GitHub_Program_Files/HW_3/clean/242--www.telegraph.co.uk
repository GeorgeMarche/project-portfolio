The IMF forecasts the economy, which was struggling even before the health crisis, will shrink 6% this year, the first contraction since 1990.\n"The last thing we want is a complete lockdown for two weeks or three weeks, we don\'t want to reach this ..It remains the last weapon if cases rise unbelievably high and lead to our hospitals being overwhelmed," Health Minister Saad Jaber told state television this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordanians wearing protective masks walk at a street of downtown Amman, Jordan\n\nCredit:\nANDRE PAIN/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4:56PM\n\nCoronavirus cases among Newcastle students unsurprising, GP says\n\n\n\nFollowing the news that 1,000 students from Newcastle University have tested positive for Covid-19,\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dr Anshumen Bhagat said "we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised by these figures as the university environment is the perfect breeding ground for the disease."\nThe NHS GP and Founder of on-demand GP service GPDQ added:\n\n"Every day we are seeing huge numbers of students from different universities across the country testing positive for Covid-19; the data coming from Newcastle is just the latest instance.\n\n \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWhile younger people are typically in a better position to fight the virus, there are real concerns about how to contain the spread when it comes to students returning for reading weeks or Christmas. Students could easily transmit the virus to vulnerable family members that are not in the position to recover so easily.\xc2\xa0\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMany universities are now hosting all lectures online; this is the right thing to do. The question is how to manage it not spreading beyond campuses. The onus is on both the students and the Universities to ensure that all responsible measures are being followed and that mandatory isolation is imposed where applicable.
