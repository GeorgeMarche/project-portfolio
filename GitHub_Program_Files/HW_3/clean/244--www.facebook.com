Lessons stay."  "There is always, always, always something to be thankful for."  "Each betrayal begins with trust."  \xe2\x80\x9cWe learn from experience that we never learn anything from experience.\xe2\x80\x9d  "Sometimes we do everything right, and we still lose."FavoritesMusicChuti Malli Podi Malli \xe0\xb6\xa0\xe0\xb7\x96\xe0\xb6\xa7\xe0\xb7\x92 \xe0\xb6\xb8\xe0\xb6\xbd\xe0\xb7\x8a\xe0\xb6\xbd\xe0\xb7\x92 \xe0\xb6\xb4\xe0\xb7\x9c\xe0\xb6\xa9\xe0\xb7\x92 \xe0\xb6\xb8\xe0\xb6\xbd\xe0\xb7\x8a\xe0\xb6\xbd\xe0\xb7\x92BooksFemale ComedyMoviesGladiatorTelevisionCSI: Crime Scene InvestigationGamesAngry BirdsOtherHilton Colombo Residence, \xe0\xb6\x9a\xe0\xb7\x85\xe0\xb7\x94 Boi -
