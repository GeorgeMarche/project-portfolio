Significant changes to mental health were found after COVID-19 onset. Specifically, this study found that older patients with multiple chronic conditions had increased loneliness, anxiety, and insomnia. They also had increased missed scheduled appointments for chronic disease care. Being female, living alone, and having more than four chronic conditions were risk factors. In an interview, Professor Wong highlights the importance of continuity of care in general practice, particularly for patients with multimorbidity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT ISSUE\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 2020 (Vol. 70 Issue 699) Table of Contents\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAlerts\n\xa0RSS\nAll Issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHighlights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The difference an end-of-life diagnosis makes: qualitative interviews with providers of community... \n  1 October 2020 \n\n Improving pain management in childhood acute otitis media in general practice: a cluster randomised... \n  1 October 2020 \n\n Appraisal, wellbeing, and pandemics: is a focus on wellbeing now warranted? \n  1 October 2020 \n\n Identification of barriers to safe opioid prescribing in primary care: a qualitative analysis of... \n  30 July 2020 \n\n Engagement with and delivery of the \xe2\x80\x98parkrun practice initiative\xe2\x80\x99 in general practice: a mixed... \n  30 July 2020 \n\n Integrating molecular point-of-care testing for influenza into primary care: a mixed-methods... \n  30 July 2020 \n\n Five principles for pandemic preparedness: lessons from the Australian COVID-19 primary care... \n  25 June 2020 \n\n Protecting the health of doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic \n  28 May 2020 \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline First\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup medical consultation for osteoporosis: a prospective pilot study of patient experience in Canadian tertiary care\nEmma O Billington, et al\nBritish Journal of General Practice 5 October 2020; bjgp20X713081.

This study of GP records also shows\xa0that GPs were adept at distinguishing symptoms of COVID-19 from common respiratory infections and saw large numbers of suspected cases. Daily counts of suspected cases recorded by GPs can act as an early warning system to detect new outbreaks of disease in the future. Watch the interview with Dr Sally Hull, who emphasises the importance of GPs recording and managing cases in their community.\n\xa0\nLegacy of grief and COVID-19\n\nIona Heath, Former President of the RCGP, writes of the many unexpected kinds of grief from COVID-19. She states: It will be very important to resist the temptation to pathologise, label, or precipitately refer on the sequelae of grief. She emphasises we must acknowledge that some communities, particularly those subject to the structural violence of poverty and racism, have been significantly more exposed to loss of parents, life partners, children, and dear friends. She describes the power of relationship-building as an investment that has the potential to make future care easier for both patient and GP.\n\xa0\nGPs' gut feelings in cancer diagnosis\n\nA systematic review suggests GPs' gut feelings may have a role in cancer diagnosis. The studies, which used varied conceptualisations of 'gut feelings', showed associations with patients initially being unwell rather than with a suspicion of cancer. Pooled odds of a cancer diagnosis were four times higher when gut feelings were recorded, and became more predictive of cancer as clinical experience and familiarity with the patient increased. This may encourage GPs to acknowledge the diagnostic value of gut feelings and have more confidence in including them in their clinical assessment. Claire Friedemann Smith explains the findings in a video interview.\n\xa0\nContinuity of care is linked to mortality\n\nA systematic review links reduced mortality rates to continuity of care, and examines causative mechanisms. In this primary-care focused study, authors from the University of Leicester, Imperial College London, and McGill University in Montreal, found a statistically significant protective effect of greater care continuity in 9 of 12 studies that measured the effect of all-cause mortality. Improved clinical responsibility, physician knowledge, and patient trust were suggested as causative mechanisms. This review adds reduced mortality to the demonstrated benefits of better continuity in primary care for patients. Some patients may benefit more than others. Despite mounting evidence of its broad benefit to patients, relationship continuity in primary care is in decline  decisive action is required from policy makers and practitioners to counter this. Also online first in the BJGP is research on what patients with ongoing problems want from relational continuity of care. This study from the University of Bristol found that patients want a GP who listens to them, who takes time with them, who cares, who takes responsibility and action, and who trusts and respects them.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neLettersMost CitedMost Read \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The forgetting curve: The importance of distribution as well as quantity of general practice teaching   \n\n The difference an end-of-life diagnosis makes  \n\n A parallel pandemic  \n\n GP trainers should learn how to provide primary care in community settings  \n\n End of the road for the 'anti-vaxxer'?  \n\n\nView all eLetters \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAltmetric Data\n\nAltmetric tracks attention and engagement of scholarly articles.
