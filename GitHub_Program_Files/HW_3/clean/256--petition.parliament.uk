They've stated how the sports will be resumed after the lockdown period. But there has been no mention of the arts. On 13 May Robert Jenrick was directly asked to pledge to protect this industry, which could be without income longer than other sectors, but he failed to give a clear answer. This further shows how the arts are being overlooked. The Govt must show more support for arts.\n\nSign this petition\n\n\n178,607 signatures\n\n\n\n\n\nShow on a map\n\n\n      100,000\n    \n\n\n\nParliament debated this\xc2\xa0topic\n\nThis topic was debated on 25 June 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the debate\nRead the transcript\n\n\n\n\nGovernment responded\nThis response was given on 20 July 2020\n\nHMG announced a \xc2\xa31.57 billion package for cultural organisations. From 11/7 outdoor performances are allowed. From 1/8, indoor performances to live audiences can restart, subject to success of pilots.\n\n\nRead the response in full\n\nThe Government recognises the huge contribution the arts and cultural sector makes, not only to the economy and international reputation of the United Kingdom, but also to the wellbeing and enrichment of its people.\nWe appreciate that this is an incredibly challenging time and that there are many cultural organisations and professionals who are currently facing difficult and uncertain circumstances. We are very alert to this issue, and are working to find solutions that support this vital sector as the lockdown eases.\nOn 5 July, the government announced a major \xc2\xa31.57 billion support package for cultural organisations to help them through the coronavirus pandemic. Culture and Heritage are at the heart of communities across the country, enriching the lives of millions, and this financial investment is testament to the role this sector plays in our lives. \nThis funding will prioritise institutions of national and international significance and those that are crucial to the valuable cultural fabric to places and communities and down the country. In order to receive support, organisations will need to demonstrate that they are at risk in this financial year and have done all they can to exhaust other options.This fund will support organisations through to the Spring of 2021. \nKey organisations in England will be able to apply for grants or loans, with loans being offered on generous terms, with low rates, an up-front repayment holiday, and long payback period. \nGrant funding will be delivered through Arts Council England, Historic England, National Lottery Heritage Fund, and the British Film Institute to support cultural and heritage organisations at risk, including publicly-funded and non-publicly-funded arts, museums and heritage organisations, music venues and independent cinemas. Details of guidance and application phases will be set out by Arms Length Bodies in due course. Further information can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/157-billion-investment-to-protect-britains-world-class-cultural-arts-and-heritage-institutions. \nIn addition, the Secretary of State for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport recently revealed a five stage roadmap that the government will work through to get the performing arts sectors back up and running as soon as possible:\nStage One - Rehearsal and training (no audiences)\nStage Two - Performances for broadcast and recording purposes\nStage Three - Performances outdoors with an audience and pilots for indoor performances with a limited socially-distanced audience\nStage Four - Performances allowed indoors and outdoors (but with a limited socially-distanced audience indoors)\nStage Five - Performances allowed indoors / outdoors (with a fuller audience indoors)\nFrom the 11th July, we will move to Stage Three. This means that performances outdoors with a socially distanced audience can take place in line with this guidance. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport is working alongside sector bodies including UK Theatre, the Association of British Orchestras, the Musicians\xe2\x80\x99 Union, One Dance UK, the Music Venue Trust and Live Comedy Association to identify suitable pilots for indoor performances with a socially distanced audience. From 1 August, indoor performances to a live audience can restart, subject to the success of pilots.\nOn 9th July we published guidance for people who work in performing arts, including arts organisations, venue operators and participants which will help people understand how they can work and take part in the performing arts safely, and keep their audiences safe. It provides advice on all aspects of performance, from casting, sound and lighting, costume and fitting, to cloakrooms, orchestra pits, hair and make-up.\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport\n\n\n\n\n\nOther parliamentary business\n\nGovernment announces \xc2\xa31.57 billion funding for cultural, arts and heritage institutions\n\nLast month MPs in the House of Commons discussed support for UK industries, including the arts and heritage sectors, in a debate arranged by the Petitions Committee.
