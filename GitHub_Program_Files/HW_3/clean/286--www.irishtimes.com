In the event the test proved positive and Dungarvan released a statement on Monday, apologising \xe2\x80\x9cfor mishandling the situation\xe2\x80\x9d.\nOn Tuesday Croke Park intervened to advise the county that in considering the matter, Waterford Competitions Control Committee should refer it to the county\xe2\x80\x99s management committee, which met the following day and ordered an investigation.\nAccording to the club statement of apology, what was represented as an error of interpretation by the club led to the player being wrongly advised. Further, he \xe2\x80\x9cdid not attend any of the post-match celebrations and was acting in good faith\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThe matter drew considerable criticism on the club and the GAA at a time when the association was deliberating whether to shut down club activity, which duly happened on Monday at lunchtime.\nNeither of the parties, the club or county officials, are willing to say anything further about the matter, pending the outcome of the investigation.\nTurbulenceAfter a summer and early autumn of predominantly positive publicity, the GAA has encountered more turbulence in the past few weeks, with scenes of post-match celebration, conducted in defiance of public health directives, taking place in a number of counties up and down the country.\nIt was the aftermath of the Cork hurling final that appears to have been the straw that broke the camel\xe2\x80\x99s back. The county board quite quickly confirmed that there would be no disciplining of Blackrock for what had happened in public on the streets on Sunday evening.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened in Waterford is different in that an infected player took the field while he was awaiting the result of a test, which is plainly contrary to GAA protocols and all public health guidelines.\nDungarvan\xe2\x80\x99s admission of error will be taken into account, but the Waterford county board are clearly unhappy with what took place, and the GAA at national level will be aware that whatever the county decides will be subject to considerable scrutiny.\nShould the investigation decide that disciplinary action is appropriate, there is a range of options, from suspension of individuals found in breach of rules to fining the club to the most drastic, which would be stripping the club of its title under Rule 7.2 (e), OG Part 1.\nUnclaimedIn such circumstances the championship wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be awarded to the defeated finalists but would go unclaimed.\nDepending on how the club viewed any disciplinary measures imposed, there would be the possibility of appeals and recourse to the Disputes Resolution Authority, the independent arbitration service for GAA units and members.\nThere is also the issue of what precedent might be set for the upcoming intercounty season.\nThe private view within the GAA at present is that there is the possibility of a player getting symptoms in the days just before a match and deciding to say nothing about it to management.\nOne distinction, though, between club and county teams is the scale of the back-up available and the presence of doctors and medical personnel, who are expected to monitor the situations more rigorously than some club set-ups are able to do.\nThere is further reassurance in the broad experience of the club season, during which no irregularities emerged when players had to stand down for Covid-related issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics:\n\nSean Moran\n\n\nCompetitions Control Committee\n\n\nDisputes Resolution Authority\n\n\nGAA\n\n\nDungarvan\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\nCovid-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nFinal two rounds of Allianz Football League games to proceed as scheduled\n                    \n\n\nHow \xe2\x80\x98breaking the chain\xe2\x80\x99 could see GAA crowds hit in the future\n                    \n\n\nClub Players\xe2\x80\x99 Association challenge \xe2\x80\x98unfair\xe2\x80\x99 decision to cancel games\n                    \n\n\nCian O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan and Dublin are all systems go for championship action\n                    \n\n\nArmagh training suspended after number of footballers test positive for coronavirus\n                    \n\n\n\nPeter Canavan calls for increased county panels to deal with coronavirus cases\n                    \n\n\nDave Hannigan: How Christy Ring aroused the curiosity of American media\n                    \n\n\nSt Loman\xe2\x80\x99s secure Westmeath title after extra time\n                    \n\n\nMohill\xe2\x80\x99s second-half salvo sees them secure the Leitrim title\n                    \n\n\nEderney deny Derrygonnelly Harps six in a row in Fermanagh\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0Subscribe.\n\n\n      \xa0\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  \t                More from The Irish Times\n\t              \t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\n\n \nGoal drought drags on as Finland repeat the dose against Ireland in Helsinki\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\n\n \nNations League: Finland 1 Ireland 0 (FT)\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\n\n \nFrom war to the Yankees to Aughrim: Mike Burke\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable life\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\n\n \nGordon D\xe2\x80\x99Arcy: Joe Schmidt will challenge referees like he previously did players\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t                Sponsored\n\t               \n\n\n\n\n \nAn ethical approach to data will help unleash the potential of AI in the Irish public sector\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAs cyberthreats evolve how do you adapt protection? \n\n\n\n\n\n \nFree resource aims to help businesses tackle employee stress and wellbeing\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWorkplace solutions that help us work together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.
