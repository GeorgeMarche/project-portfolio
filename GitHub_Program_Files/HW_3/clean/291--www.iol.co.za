A total of 105 deaths were recorded in KwaZulu-Natal, 18 in the Eastern Cape, 6 in the Free State, 13 in Gauteng, 6 in Limpopo, 4 in Mpumalanga and 8 in the Western Cape.

The number of recoveries now stand at 618 771, which translates to a recovery rate of 90%. '\xe2\x80\x99There has been a noticeable increase in the number of deaths recently which caused us concern as we have received reports from the Medical Research Council (MRC) that there have been no excess deaths for three weeks in a row,\xe2\x80\x9c Mkhize said.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99We therefore consulted the provinces to ascertain the reason for the increased numbers. We have received reports that the provinces are implementing the recommendations of the MRC to reconcile the data with Home Affairs deaths data. \xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99In addition, provinces are auditing the deaths data either by mining data from the DATCOV surveillance reports and identifying unreported deaths or auditing the facilities on the ground. \xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99We welcome this robust refinement of data collation as it reassures us that, moving forward, we excersise precision in our epidemiological surveillance.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99The cumulative number of tests conducted to date is 4 339 686, with 21 172 new tests conducted since the last report.
