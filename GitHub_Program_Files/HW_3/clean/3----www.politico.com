That is a shocking statement even for this President,\xe2\x80\x9d Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must immediately apologize. Failure to do so would be yet another example of his callous disregard and disrespect for the women and men of our Armed Forces who we ask to stand in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way,\xe2\x80\x9d Reed said.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in her weekly press conference on Capitol Hill that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments underscore the need for the administration to disclose when the president last tested negative for the coronavirus.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very important question for our country, because now the president is saying that he probably got this from the Gold Star families,\xe2\x80\x9d Pelosi said. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you believe that he would say such a thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the interview, Trump told host Maria Bartiromo that he \xe2\x80\x9cfigured there would be a chance\xe2\x80\x9d he would become infected with the coronavirus, citing his meetings with the families of America\xe2\x80\x99s war dead at the White House on Sept. 27.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, I\xe2\x80\x99d be in groups of, for instance, Gold Star families. I met with Gold Star families. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to cancel that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they all came in, and they all talk about their son and daughter and father. And, you know, they all came up to me, and they tell me a story.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTrump explained that as he was being told these stories about fallen service members, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say, \xe2\x80\x98Back up, stand 10 feet,\xe2\x80\x99 you know? I just can\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Gold Star family members \xe2\x80\x9ccome within an inch of my face, sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey want to hug me, and they want to kiss me. And they do. And, frankly, I\xe2\x80\x99m not telling them to back up. I\xe2\x80\x99m not doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday afternoon, White House spokesperson Alyssa Farah said Trump was not blaming Gold Star families for potentially infecting him and that it was unlikely he contracted Covid-19 from the event.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis point was merely that in the timeframe that he was potentially exposed, there were a number of different venues he\xe2\x80\x99d been at and individuals he had interacted with that it could have come from \xe2\x80\x94 and by no means are blaming anyone who was present,\xe2\x80\x9d Farah said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we did take a lot of precautions for that event. So based on contact tracing, the data we have, we don\'t think it arose from that event.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt is not yet known where exactly Trump contracted Covid-19, and the White House has refused to provide a definitive timeline of the president\xe2\x80\x99s coronavirus tests in the days leading up to his diagnosis.\nApart from the meetings the president described Thursday, he has held large-scale campaign rallies in recent months where attendees do not practice social distancing and many of his supporters do not wear masks.\nThe day before the Gold Star event, Trump also presided over a packed, mostly mask-less White House Rose Garden ceremony where he nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.\nThat ceremony, which was attended by numerous administration officials and members of Congress, has since been identified as a potential superspreader event.\nSeveral other Democrats piled on Thursday after Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments. Rep. Anthony Brown (D-Md.), a retired Army Reserve colonel, wrote on Twitter that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Gold Star remarks show he "will never take responsibility and will always think he\xe2\x80\x99s above the people he serves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n"The President who refused to stand up to Putin in defense of our troops is now offloading blame on Gold Star families, who\'ve sacrificed everything for our nation,\xe2\x80\x9d Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, added on Twitter. "It\xe2\x80\x99s time for this President to show respect for our military & take responsibility for his failed #COVID response.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSeveral high-ranking military leaders also attended the Gold Star event. Among them was Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard Adm. Charles Ray, who tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday \xe2\x80\x94 prompting all but one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to self-quarantine because they had met with Ray in a secure conference room at the Pentagon last Friday.\nA second high-ranking officer who was at the Pentagon meeting, Assistant Marine Commandant Gen. Gary Thomas, tested positive Wednesday. \nNone of the other military leaders who met with Ray on Friday has since tested positive, and the Pentagon says they are able to do their jobs while quarantined.\n"The Joint Chiefs and I remain in constant communication while in quarantine and the chain of command remains the same,\xe2\x80\x9d Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said in a statement. "There has been no impact on our ability to effectively plan, coordinate and synchronize efforts to defend our nation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAll top leaders who had contact with Ray last week will be tested again on Friday. Yet defense officials are now saying the Pentagon will no longer announce negative test results, only positive ones.\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s comments about the Gold Star event come one week after he floated a theory that infected service members and law enforcement officers were potentially responsible for White House aide Hope Hicks testing positive for Covid-19.\nHicks\xe2\x80\x99 diagnosis was the apparent first in a wave of infections that have consumed the White House, upended the presidential race and resulted in a new outbreak in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital. \n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic, and she\xe2\x80\x99s done a great job,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump told Fox News\xe2\x80\x99 Sean Hannity at the time. \n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s very, very hard when you are with people from the military or from law enforcement,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they come over to you and they \xe2\x80\x94 they want to hug you, and they want to kiss you because we really have done a good job for them. And you get close, and things happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLara Seligman and David Brown contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump tests positive\nThe White House physician says President Donald Trump has tested negative for Covid-19.
