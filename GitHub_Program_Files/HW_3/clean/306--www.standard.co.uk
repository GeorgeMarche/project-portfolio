The data suggested the known higher risks for men \xe2\x80\x9cemerge later in the disease trajectory\xe2\x80\x9d, the study said.\n\n\n\n\nBlack, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) adults were meanwhile twice as likely to present with suspected coronavirus than white adults, according to the data gathered.\nThe increased risk to BAME groups was not necessarily due to other factors such as health conditions, obesity or social deprivation, the study said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\nBrits warned to stick to Covid rules or risk tougher measures\n\n\n\n\nAirlines urge virus testing as Brits on Greek islands rush back home\n\n\n\n\nWe need to start taking virus very seriously again, warns deputy CMO\n\n\n\n\nPhil Foden issues public apology for coronavirus breach\n\n\n\n\nUK coronavirus rate rises above Government's travel quarantine limit\n\n\n\nDr Hull added: \xe2\x80\x9cThe high prevalence among BAME patients remains a big concern and we now know that ethnicity is still a risk factor even after you take account of social deprivation, long-term conditions and body mass index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo there is something else driving this, which urgently requires more research.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe study's researchers looked at anonymised data from the primary care records of about 1.2 million adults registered with 157 practices in four east London clinical commissioning groups during the pandemic\xe2\x80\x99s peak.\nThe research focused on suspected cases as coronavirus test results were not sent to GPs during the study period. It was also not able to include measures such as household size, employment factors, travel and the availability of personal protective equipment.\nThree of the four boroughs studied had death rates that were in the top five for London while 55 per cent of the population in those areas were from ethnic minorities.\nDr Hull said GPs need \xe2\x80\x9ctimely reporting\xe2\x80\x9d of test results to their practices and diagnostic information from NHS 111 to ensure patients with more severe episodes receive continuing care.\nShe said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be very important how GPs record and manage cases in their community, as this can provide an early warning system if cases are rising again in an area and if we\xe2\x80\x99re about to see a second wave of infection.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nMore about:\n|\n\n                      United Kingdom\n                    \n|\n\n                      Coronavirus\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\nLog in or\n            register to comment\n          \n\n\n\n\n (Logout)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost\n\n\n\n\nPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.\n\nCommunity Guidelines\n\nYou may not agree with our views, or other users\xe2\x80\x99, but please respond to them respectfully\nSwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptable\nDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third parties\nWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notification\n\nYou can find our Community Guidelines in full\n                here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefresh\xe2\x80\xa2\nSubscribe\xe2\x80\xa2\nRSS\n\n\n\nLoading comments...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotifications\n\n\n\n\nEnter your email to subscribe to new comments on this article.\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you sure you want to submit this vote?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, submit this vote\nCancel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Comment\n\n\n\n\nAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?\n\n\n\n\nYes, flag this comment\nCancel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete Comment\n\n\n\n\nAre you sure you want to delete this comment?\n\n\n\n\nYes, delete this comment\nCancel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular videos\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Topics\nAll Authors\nArchive\nTerms of use\nContact Us\nPrivacy policy\nCookie policy\nCode of Conduct & Complaints\nAdvertisers\nPromotion rules\nContributors\nSyndication\nHomes & Property\nJobs\nLondon Live\nThe Independent\nThis is London Magazine\nindy100\nInstall our apps\nVoucher Codes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
