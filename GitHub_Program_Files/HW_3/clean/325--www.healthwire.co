If so, the largest body of private practitioners also wanted an explanation that whether the evidence was weak or moderate or strong.\nHe (Harsh Vardhan) has arranged impressive names of institutions to support his prescription. He admits that these are based on empirical evidence which means that the evidence is anecdotal and based on individual subjective experiences. He himself relegates AYUSH as history rather than current by saying Ayurveda has contributed to the foundation of modern medicine,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement issued by the IMA reads.\nOther questions posed by the IMA are\n Whether the severe form of COVID-19 a hyperimmune status or an immune deficiency status?\n Whether the proponents of this claim and his Ministry are prepared to subject themselves as volunteers to an independent prospective Double-Blind Control Study in the prevention and treatment of COVID?\n How many of his ministerial colleagues have so far made the informed choice of getting treated under these protocols?\n What is stopping him from handing over COVID care and control to AYUSH ministry?\nALSO READ | Dr. Harsh Vardhan Releases Covid-19 Safe Workplace Guidelines For Industry\nThe association also said that by failing to answer their questions Dr Harsh Vardhan will be inflicting a fraud on the nation and gullible patients by calling placebos as drugs.\xc2\xa0\nEarlier on Tuesday, Dr Harsh Vardhan released the National Clinical Management Protocol that is based on Ayurveda and Yoga for the management of the coronavirus.\nDuring the launch, Vardhan said that the research the protocol was prepared by the experts and other national research organizations. He said the National Clinical Management Protocol is based on Ayurveda and Yoga.\nNational Clinical Management Protocol\nThe National Clinical Management Protocol ends the ambiguity around using Ayurveda and Yoga-based solutions to clinical treatment of the coronavirus. Other versions of the protocol will be released soon and it will cover other disciplines of Ayush.\nThis protocol has clear guidelines about the treatment of coronavirus positive persons. This will ensure uniformity and consistency in the responses to the pandemic based on Ayush across the country.\n\nFacebook Comments\n \n\n \n\n TAGSAyurvedaAYUSH-Based Protocol For COVID-19 TreatmentCovid TreatmentHarsh VardhanIMANational Clinical Management Protocol \nPrevious articleTired But Cant Sleep?
