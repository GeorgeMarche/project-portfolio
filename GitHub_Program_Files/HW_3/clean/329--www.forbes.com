But what if wearing a mask or staying six feet apart from each other isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to put team members\xe2\x80\x99 minds at ease?\nLook around online, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see all sorts of other gadgets that offer protection against transmissible disease. While some of them are more appropriate for office settings than others, all make it that much more difficult for the virus to spread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the pandemic has changed office life, it\xe2\x80\x99s also provided a unique opportunity for innovators ... [+] to dream up new solutions.\n\ngetty\n\n\nWhen it comes to reducing Covid-19\xe2\x80\x99s spread, every little bit helps. If you have a little extra money to spend, these five unique approaches can reduce your team\xe2\x80\x99s risk:\n1. Treat the air with UV light.\nAlthough practically everyone is wearing a face mask these days, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t breathing fresh, sanitary air. That\xe2\x80\x99s where uvSABA comes into play.\xa0\n\nRecommended For YouThe Real Reasons You Can\xe2\x80\x99t Focus On Your WorkCustomer Service Week: A List Of Thanks And CelebrationsHow To Improve Your Working From Home Game With These HacksuvSABA\xe2\x80\x99s team of inventors and advisors includes Ph.D. scientists, electrical engineers and physicians. Worn over the nose and mouth, its safe-air breathing apparatus (SABA) actually cleans the air you breathe.\nHow does it work? The SABA draws in air from the base of the unit, which is immediately exposed to ultraviolet light. UVC light has been proven to kill bacteria and genetically scramble viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19). The sterilized air then travels through a tube to a comfortable face adapter, and a surplus of treated air forms an invisible shield.\n\n2. Disinfect whole rooms from above.\nUV light has other in-office sanitization applications as well. Puro, for instance, now sells mountable UV light fixtures to organizations seeking one-touch disinfection of large spaces. After installing Puro\xe2\x80\x99s Helo fixtures in a room, users can schedule complete UV-based disinfection of all exposed surfaces when no one is around.\xa0\xa0\nPuro is not the only company using UV light to sanitize high-traffic areas. Dallas startup PureBeam offers in-depth workspace UV disinfection as a service. Unlike other companies offering commercial disinfection, PureBeam can sanitize spaces without the mess or residue left by aerosol cleaners.\n3. Screen groups using thermal imaging.\nOne way to combat the spread of Covid-19 is to identify and quarantine those presenting with fevers. The trouble is that businesses may not be able to effectively screen every person who comes through their doors.\xa0\nScylla thinks it has the answer: thermal screening powered by AI. Scylla\xe2\x80\x99s system can work with any thermal camera to pick individuals out of a crowd who may have elevated body temperatures. The system sends out automated alerts, enabling early detection of individuals who may be ill.\nThough the system isn\xe2\x80\x99t foolproof, it can be used as a first line of defense against the spread of Covid-19. Scylla\xe2\x80\x99s thermal-screening technology is ideal for airports, hospitals, schools and other high-traffic public places.\n4. Provide personal bubbles.\nFor some people, wearing even an N95 face mask feels like too little protection. These individuals will be happy to learn that they can now get 360-degree protection from the chest up by wearing a personal air-purifying shield from VYZR Technologies.\xa0\nAdmittedly, VYZR\xe2\x80\x99s invention looks like something out of a science-fiction film. Nevertheless, the shield promises to not only provide a better barrier than masks, but also to deliver a continuous supply of filtered air.\xa0\nThe BioVYZR is actually a powered air-purifying respirator worn on a fitted Neoprene vest. Incoming air is pumped by a battery-powered unit before the air enters the tightly sealed BioVYZR. When a user exhales, the air is naturally forced out through vents on the sides.\xa0\nThe BioVYZR is one-size-fits-all for adults and also comes in a kids\xe2\x80\x99 size. As the company notes, the shield has the added benefit of removing the temptation for face-touching.\n5. Give out antimicrobial gloves.\nAlthough the BioVYZR looks like something from the future, not all pandemic inventions are quite so high-tech. Take the Ghluv, for instance. The product looks more like an 1980s-inspired tennis wristband than a way to outsmart germs, but the principle behind the Ghluv makes sense for those who want to limit contact with frequently touched surfaces.\nAll Ghluvs are constructed from fabric that has been given an antibacterial and antiviral textile treatment. To wear a Ghluv, simply keep the fabric pushed up around your wrist; pull the fabric down when you want to open a door or wrap your hand around a shopping cart. Though they\xe2\x80\x99re not necessarily on-trend from a fashion standpoint, wearing a Ghluv could mean the difference between getting sick and staying well.\xa0\nWhile the pandemic has changed office life, it\xe2\x80\x99s also provided a unique opportunity for innovators to dream up new solutions. Until everyone can be vaccinated, your mother\xe2\x80\x99s favorite maxim applies: better safe than sorry.\nCheck out\xa0my\xa0website.\xa0Serenity GibbonsSerenity Gibbons is a former assistant editor at The Wall Street Journal.
