Please note that not all countries are reporting recovered cases.\nProgress Comparison\nHere you can compare progress of coronavirus COVID-19 between different countries. Graph start at moment when there were 100 confirmed cases.\nPeak Analysis Comparison\nHere you can compare peak analysis for two different countries.\n\n Source of the data are  Johns Hopkins University \n\n\n\nInformation about Coronavirus COVID-19\n\nThe COVID\xe2\x80\x9119 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\xe2\x80\x9119) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\xe2\x80\x91CoV\xe2\x80\x912). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 20 September 2020, more than 30.8 million cases have been reported in 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 958,000 deaths; more than 21 million people have recovered. \nThe disease mainly spreads between people when they are in close proximity. It spreads very easily and sustainably, primarily via contaminated droplets produced during breathing, coughing, sneezing, talking and singing. Many larger droplets rapidly fall to the ground, however some can be suspended in air as aerosols, especially in indoor spaces. It may also be transmitted via contaminated surfaces, although this has not been conclusively demonstrated. It can spread for up to two days prior to symptom onset, and from people who are asymptomatic. People remain infectious in moderate cases for 7\xe2\x80\x9312 days, and up to two weeks in severe cases. \nCommon symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell. Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The incubation period is typically around five days but may range from one to 14 days. There are several vaccine candidates in development, although none have completed clinical trials to prove their safety and efficacy. There is no known specific antiviral medication, so primary treatment is currently symptomatic. \nRecommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering mouth when coughing, social distancing, wearing a face mask in public, disinfecting surfaces, ventilating and air-filtering, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they may be infected. Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures to slow the spread of the disease. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of the infected. \nThe pandemic has caused global social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression. According to estimations, up to 100 million people have fallen into extreme poverty and global famines are affecting 130 million people. It has led to the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. Educational institutions have been partially or fully closed, with many switching to online schooling. Misinformation about the virus has circulated through social media and mass media. There have been many incidents of xenophobia and racism against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.\nSource: Wikipedia.org \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\nRecent Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa92020 Coronavirus COVID-19 Cases\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t | Powered by WordPress and Superb Themes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
