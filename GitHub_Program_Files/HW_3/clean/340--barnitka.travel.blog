I even had bought ticket a few days before. Im using my points from the travels I had done with work, its so much easier this way, as []\nRead More Three days in\xa0Brazzaville \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPointe-Noire to Brazzaville \n\nI showed up at the Ocean du Nord bus station around 5:45am, just like I was told. Apparently there are two Ocean du Nord stations in town but somehow the taxi managed to take me to the right one (the taxi driver asked if I would be travelling from that station and he knew which []\nRead More Pointe-Noire to Brazzaville \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree days in\xa0Pointe-Noire \n\nThe mornings in town were rather lazy. I was going out across the street to have a baguette with an avocado salad and a cup of nescafe. Sueco where I stayed also did food but it was expensive. I once took a seafish bullion with vegetables, it was nice but if was also 3500cfa. Oops.

I ran out of the 3GB space allowance on this site and I am not willing to upgrade. Running a blog on a mobile phone on WordPress is a joke. Anytime I try editing posts that have photos all formatting goes bust, all []\nRead More Gabon to Congo, Ndend\xc3\xa9 to Dolisie to\xa0Pointe-Noire \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLambar\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9 and Ndend\xc3\xa9 \n\nThe initial plan of seeing Albert Schweitzer Hospital in the morning and catching afternoon transport to Ndend\xc3\xa9, the last town in Gabon before Congo, of course failed. There are men in town around where the transport North (Libreville etc.) and South (Mouila & Ndend\xc3\xa9) leaves who somehow match passengers to vehicles. One of them gave []\nRead More Lambar\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9 and Ndend\xc3\xa9 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibreville to Lambar\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9 \n\nTaxi to PK8 I called for 1000cfa, but not before I had my baguette with salad and coffee, two coffees. PK8 sounds like kilometre 8, away from the city. The taxi driver told me I should watch out for price hikes for a white man and told me I should not pay more than 5000cfa.The []\nRead More Libreville to Lambar\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo days in\xa0Libreville \n\nIn my comfortable bed with my very comfortable pillows and fresh crispy linen I slept very well. First stop: du caf\xc3\xa9. I had three cups. 300cfa each. I asked where to get the coffee that is the not ground. The men told me to go to ancien Sobraga (later I found out Sobraga stands for []\nRead More Two days in\xa0Libreville \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitam to Libreville \n\nI found two agencies in Bitam going to Libreville. One told me the bus leaves at 4am and the next one going at 7am. There was a big bus and a small.bus standing there. The big bus looked promising. The other one told me the bus leaves at 5am, then they told me 5am is []\nRead More Bitam to Libreville \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEbolowa, Cameroon to Bitam, Gabon, attempt no.\xa02 \n\nArmed with printed reservations I took a moto to immigration office. There I had to wait a bit as Mr Johnson was not yet in the office at 9am. It took a minute to get a stamp, he didnt bother registering me again, I was there already the day before. I took an omelette in []\nRead More Ebolowa, Cameroon to Bitam, Gabon, attempt no.\xa02 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEbolowa, Cameroon to Bitam,\xa0Gabon \n\nWe rode in a moto for long, I asked him to take me where transport to Ambam leaves. Ambam is the last town before Cameroon ends, about 30kms away from both Gabon and Equatorial Guinea borders. Ebolowa suddenly seemed much larger than it looked. I was dropped on the roadside, no bus agency in sight, []\nRead More Ebolowa, Cameroon to Bitam,\xa0Gabon \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosts navigation\nOlder Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tComing back to Maman\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nBlog at WordPress.com. \n\n\n\n\n\nPost to\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
