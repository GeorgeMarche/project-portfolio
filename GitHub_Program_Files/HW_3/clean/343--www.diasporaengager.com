Diaspora usually refers to people who, for any reasons, are living in a country or a town that is not their place of origin/ancestry or the place where they grew up or may have lived for a long time. Some people may call them immigrants, strangers, or aliens. Some may argue that, most individuals can be remotely linked to a country of origin different than their current country of residence. In our context, Diaspora refers to any human being. Sign Up Today. It is Free!\n Why DiasporaEngager? Reason # 16:  Looking for a volunteer position? Looking to hire volunteers?
