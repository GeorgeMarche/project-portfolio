That does not mean that the trial necessarily has to be completed as designed because each of the trials has interim looks at the data that are stipulated in the protocols that can allow an evaluation of the data once the data meets certain apriori established numbers of cases that would allow some kind of conclusion to be drawn, depending on the actual efficacy of the vaccine",\xc2\xa0Katherine O\'Brien said at a briefing.14:21Number of COVID-19 Cases in US Rises by 56,000, Reports Say14:14WHO Says Health Workers, Elderly People Need to Get Vaccinated FirstThe Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) of the World Health Organisation (WHO) laid out recommendations on the immunization of the population from the coronavirus and said that health workers and elderly people should be prioritised, Kate O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, the director of the WHO Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, said.\nAccording to O\'Brien, the document prepared by the SAGE and due to be published later this year, laid out recommendations on stages of immunization depending on the epidemiological situation. The first stage should cover 10 percent of the population, the second stage - between 11 and 20 percent, and the third one should cover beyond 20 percent. The official noted that there is a possibility that at the early stage of vaccine rollouts countries may not be able to get enough doses to vaccinate 10 percent of their population.\n"So SAGE tried to give a further steer on what would be the highest priority for the very first set of doses that arrive and then what would be the next priority within that stage one of phasing. The two highest priorities are to immunise both health care workers, who have high or very high risk of infection with COVID, and the second group is those adults who are older adults - we\'ll use the word \'elderly\' here - to be defined by each country of what the age categorisation would be for those that are at the highest risk of serious illness and death", O\'Brien said at a briefing.\nThe expert also said that other groups should be prioritised in further stages of immunisation, and countries should be able to make adjustments based on the epidemiological situation.14:02Trump to Undergo \'Medical Evaluation\' on TV Administered by Fox News Doctor, Reports Suggest13:55MP\'s Get Pay Rise?
