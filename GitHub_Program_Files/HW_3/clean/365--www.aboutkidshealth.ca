Many of these issues either go away on their own or with the help of prescription medicine. Proper \n   <a href="/Article?contentid=967&language=English">foreskin care</a> is the best way to prevent many of these issues.</p><p>Other foreskin problems, such as an accidental injury are more serious. These types of issues need treatment right away.</p><h2>Key points</h2><ul><li>Adhesions can form along the tip of the penis (glans), as the foreskin naturally separates from it. These are normal, require no treatment and go away on their own.<br></li><li>Pus-like clumps called smegma can sometimes form as the foreskin naturally retracts. This is normal, requires no treatment and goes away on its own.</li><li>Zipper injuries are common and require emergency treatment.</li><li>In babies, a hair or thread may tightly twist around the penis, interfering with blood flow (hair tourniquet). This is serious and requires emergency treatment.</li><li>Some children may forget to unretract their foreskin, causing it to form a painful, tight ring around the penis (paraphimosis). Using anaesthetic cream and pain medicine, a doctor can help push the foreskin to its original position.</li><li>If your child experiences bleeding, irritation or white scarring of the foreskin, take them to see a doctor.</li></ul><h2>Adhesions and smegma</h2><p>As a child gets older, the foreskin naturally separates from the head of the penis (glans). As this happens, the following may occur.</p><ul><li>Parts of the foreskin may remain attached (adhesions). This is normal and does not need any treatment. The foreskin fully separates by the time a child reaches puberty. Until then, there may be temporary soreness or pain while urinating. This usually goes away after a day or two.</li><li>The foreskin naturally sheds, leaving small white or yellow clumps behind. These clumps are called smegma and may look like pus. The smegma eventually goes away on its own. There is no need for treatment.</li></ul><h2>Balanitis</h2><p>Balanitis is an infection which may cause the foreskin to become red, swollen and itchy. You may also notice a build-up of fluid and your child may experience pain while urinating. Proper foreskin care can prevent balanitis.</p><h3>Treating balanitis</h3><p>If the balanitis is mild, your child\xe2\x80\x99s doctor may prescribe an antifungal cream, such as nystatin, clotrimazole or miconazole. If the foreskin\xc2\xa0infection is severe or keeps coming back, circumcision may be an option once the redness and swelling go away. Talk to your child\'s doctor to learn more. Good hygiene can also help prevent balanitis from coming back.</p><h2>Bacterial infection</h2><p>If there is a cut or sore on the foreskin, bacteria can enter the skin and cause an infection. The bacteria can quickly spread along the entire foreskin. This can cause a bacterial infection called balanoposthitis. The penis and foreskin swell, become red and feel painful and very sensitive to the touch.</p><h3>Treating bacterial infection in the foreskin</h3><p>If your child has developed a bacterial infection, talk to your doctor about treatment. In most cases, bacterial infection inside the foreskin or penis can be treated using either:</p><ul><li>antibiotics by mouth or</li><li>topical antibiotics (antibiotic creams for the skin)</li></ul><p>Your child\xe2\x80\x99s doctor may prescribe oral and topical antibiotics together.</p><p>In adolescents, other conditions may cause an infection. If your teen develops an infection or inflammation on their penis or foreskin, they should see a doctor.</p><p>To ease pain or discomfort, your child can sit in a warm bath with added bath salts (do not use bubble baths or perfumed soaps). They can also take pain medicine such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If your child develops a fever, they should see a doctor.</p><h2>Zipper injury</h2><p>Your child may accidently injure their foreskin by getting it caught in the teeth of a zipper. Aside from being very painful, a zipper injury may damage the tip of the tube inside the penis through which urine flows, called the urethral meatus.</p><p>If a zipper injury happens, take your child to the emergency department right away. Trying to remove skin trapped in a stuck zipper may cause more injury. Leave it alone or cut the clothing around the zipper to make it easier to take them to the hospital.</p><h3>Treating a zipper injury</h3><p>Before detaching the zipper from the penis, your child\'s doctor may give your child some pain medicine. The doctor may inject a small amount of anaesthetic medicine at the base of the penis to numb it for a short time.</p><h2>Hair tourniquet</h2><p>In babies, a hair or thread may tightly twist around the penis, interfering with blood flow. This is called a hair tourniquet.</p><p>The hair or thread may appear as a thin line around the penis, and the affected area usually swells and reddens. Sometimes the hair or thread may be very difficult to see. If you notice swelling, discoloration or redness of the penis and suspect a hair tourniquet, take your baby to the hospital right away. If it is not dealt with right away, a hair tourniquet can damage nerves or blood vessels.</p><h3>Treating a hair tourniquet</h3><p>Your doctor will try to remove the tourniquet by applying a hair removal cream to the area. They may consult a urologist if the hair is deeply embedded in the skin. More serious cases may require surgery.</p><h2>Paraphimosis</h2><p>As a child gets older, their foreskin loosens and they are able to pull back (retract) the foreskin. They can also push the foreskin back to its original position (unretract), covering the head of the penis (glans).</p><p>Sometimes, a child may forget to unretract their foreskin. As a result, it becomes a tight band around the penis shaft. This is a condition called paraphimosis, which causes swelling and pain. Fluid can also build up around the area, causing further swelling.</p>\n<figure class="asset-c-80"> \n   <span class="asset-image-title">Paraphimosis</span>\n   <img src="https://assets.aboutkidshealth.ca/akhassets/Paraphimosis_MED_ILL_EN.png" alt="Normal penis and penis with paraphimosis" />\n   <figcaption class="asset-image-caption">The penis is covered by a ring of tissue called the foreskin. In a normal penis, the foreskin is loose and retractable to show the glans (head of the penis). In a penis with paraphimosis, the foreskin is so swollen and tight around the shaft that it cannot be unretracted to cover the glans.</figcaption> </figure>\n<h3>Treating paraphimosis</h3><p>If your child develops paraphimosis, take them to the doctor or an emergency department right away. Paraphimosis rarely requires surgery, but only a doctor should unretract the foreskin.</p><p>Before starting, the doctor will apply an anaesthetic cream. They may also prescribe pain medicine to relieve any discomfort. As the swelling reduces, the doctor will gently unretract the foreskin. Most children will need pain management or even sedation for this procedure.</p><h2>Phimosis</h2><p>A related condition, called phimosis, occurs when children are unable to retract the foreskin. In newborns, the foreskin is usually not retractable. As your child gets older, the foreskin will slowly become easier to retract. The foreskin is usually retractable by late childhood or early adulthood. Children who are not experiencing any discomfort or symptoms do not need to be seen by a doctor, even if they cannot fully retract their foreskin.</p><p>Sometimes, children are unable to retract their foreskin due to scarring from a previous infection, trauma or inflammation. In these cases, your child should see a doctor. </p><p>Your child should also see a doctor if they experience:</p><ul><li>irritation or bleeding at the tip of the foreskin</li><li>a ring of white scarring at the tip of the foreskin</li><li>severe ballooning of the foreskin when urinating, requiring pressure to push the urine out(If your child has ballooning of the foreskin while urinating that resolves on its own, they do not need to be seen by a doctor</li><li>recurrent foreskin\xc2\xa0infections\xc2\xa0that require antibiotic treatment</li></ul><p>For information on treating phimosis, please visit the Health A-Z page on \n   <a href="/Article?contentid=889&language=English">Phimosis</a>.</p>foreskinforeskin \xe2\x80\x8bLearn how to treat common foreskin problems and when to see a doctor.

The HPV vaccine protects against the most common strains of the virus.<br></p><h2>What is human papillomavirus (HPV)? </h2><p>The \n   <a href="/Article?contentid=25&language=English">human papillomavirus (HPV)</a> is a virus that spreads through sexual intercourse, oral sex, anal sex and also sexual touching (hand to genital contact). HPV is the most common sexually transmitted disease in Canada. Most people do not know that they have HPV because they do not have any symptoms. Unfortunately, they can still pass on the virus to their partner. Persistent HPV infection can lead to certain types of cancers. </p><p>HPV is very common. About\xc2\xa0one in four Canadians under the age of 25 have HPV. </p><p>There are many different strains of HPV. The HPV vaccine protects against the four most common strains:<br></p><ul><li>The strains HPV-6 and HPV-11 cause \n      <a href="/Article?contentid=25&language=English">genital warts</a>.</li><li>HPV-16 and HPV-18 are the leading cause of cancers of the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus that narrows into a canal and opens into the vagina. These strains can also cause cancers in the penis and anus as well as cancers of the head and neck. </li></ul><p>In Canada, two vaccines can protect against HPV: Gardasil\xc2\xa0and Cervarix. </p><h2>How can the HPV vaccine help protect against HPV? </h2><p>Gardasil protects against four types of HPV: </p><ul><li>HPV-16 and HPV-18, which cause about 70 percent of all cancers of the cervix</li><li>HPV-6 and HPV-11, which cause about 90 percent of all genital warts </li></ul><p>Gardasil can be prescribed to females between the ages of nine and 45. The vaccine is licensed for use in males age nine to 26. It offers protection against certain cancers of the penis, anus, head and neck. It also protects the partners of males who have had the vaccine. Unfortunately, the cost of the vaccine for boys is not yet funded by most public health programs. </p><p>Cervarix protects against HPV-16 and HPV-18. It is given to females between the ages of 10 and 25. </p><p>Both vaccines require three doses to be given over the course of six months (Cervarix is given at zero, one and six months; Gardasil is given at zero, two and six months). In Canada, one of the vaccines is given to females in school in Grade 4-8, depending on the province (see table below). </p><h2>Important facts about the HPV vaccine</h2><p>There are many common misconceptions about the HPV virus and vaccine. The correct information is provided below so that you have all the facts when discussing sexual health and the HPV vaccine with your child.</p><h3>The HPV vaccine is \n   <em>not</em> a substitute for regular checkups </h3><p>The vaccine protects against some types of HPV that can potentially lead to cancers. Regular checkups with the doctor are still important. About 30% of cervical cancers will not be prevented by the vaccine because it does not cover all HPV strains. Women should continue to be screened for cervical cancer with pap smears, even after getting all three shots of either HPV vaccine. </p><h3>The vaccine \n   <em>cannot </em>treat HPV infections or HPV-related disease </h3><p>HPV vaccine helps prevent HPV-related infections or disease but will not treat an infection. It is most effective in women who are not yet sexually active because they are less likely to have contracted an HPV infection. </p><h3>There is currently \n   <em>no medical cure</em> for the HPV virus </h3><p>Once someone is infected it can take weeks to months before genital warts become apparent. Warts inside the vaginal or anal areas may not be obvious. Some home therapies and other treatments in the doctor\'s office can be used to treat warts, but none can completely eliminate the virus. Even if the warts disappear, the virus can remain and warts recur. When warts are treated it can take 8 months or longer for them to disappear. </p><h3>HPV vaccines \n   <em>do not </em>protect against other sexually transmitted infections </h3><p>The HPV vaccine protects against genital warts, which is one type of sexually transmitted infection (STI). It cannot protect against all types of STIs, such as HIV, chlamydia, or gonorrhea. It is important to practice safe sex. Parents should advise teens on how to reduce their risk of contracting STIs.<br></p><h3>The HPV vaccine \n   <em>will not</em> make your child more promiscuous </h3><p>There is no evidence that giving the vaccination will increase sexual activity. </p><p>The HPV vaccination is an opportunity for parents to discuss sex and health with their children.\xc2\xa0<a href="/Article?contentid=718&language=English">Parents should be talking about sex with their children </a>regularly. </p><p>Studies show that sex education does not increase sexual activity. In fact, sex education may decrease early sexual activity, especially if the message encourages delaying sex and having protected sex. </p><h2>Can sexually active females benefit from the vaccine? </h2><p>The vaccines are most beneficial when given to girls before becoming sexually active. For this reason, doctors usually prescribe HPV vaccines to girls between the ages nine and 13. However, few sexually active women are infected with all types of HPV. For this reason, the vaccine can still help prevent infection and can be given to girls older than 14 years of age. A person with HPV usually has it for life. However, the vaccine can still help prevent recurrences. </p><h2>Is the vaccine protection long-lasting? </h2><p>Studies show that people exhibit strong immunity against HPV. Scientists do not know exactly how long the vaccine protects again HPV because long-term studies have not been done, but protection is for at least five years. </p><h2>Are the HPV vaccines safe? </h2><p>Studies show both HPV vaccines are safe. For both vaccines, the most common side effect is soreness at the site of injection. This is temporary. </p><p>The only reason not to get the vaccine would be if you have had an allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or if you are pregnant. </p><p>The vaccines contain particles from part of the virus. They cannot infect you with HPV. The vaccines also do not contain any antibiotics or preservatives, such as mercury or thimerosal. Cervarix\xc2\xa0contains a new additive called (ASO4). According to Health Canada, ASO4 is safe. </p><p>For more information, visit \n   <a href="http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/health-sante/sexual-sexuelle/hpv-vph-eng.php">Health Canada</a>. </p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Separate fact from fiction with up-to-date and accurate information on the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.MainJIAJIAJIAJEnglishNATeen (13-18 years)NANANATeen (13-15 years)NA2018-03-16T04:00:00ZLanding PageLearning Hub<p>The Taking Charge: Managing JIA Online Program provides teens with information on different types of JIA, managing symptoms, and coping with JIA management now and in the future.<br></p><p>The Taking Charge: Managing JIA Online Program provides teens with information on different types of JIA, managing symptoms, and coping with JIA management now and in the future.<br></p><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading clickable">\n      <span class="pull-right panel-heading-collapsable-icon"> \n         <i class="mdi mdi-chevron-down"></i></span> \n      <h2 class="panel-title">Getting started</h2></div><div class="panel-body list-group" style="display:none;"><p>Welcome to the Taking Charge: Managing JIA Online Program!
