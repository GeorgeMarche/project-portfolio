The owners of those facilities were threatened with federal criminal prosecution and asset forfeiture despite being certified.The U. S. Attorneys in California are not targeting individuals and organizations that are operating outside of the law, but instead are aggressively persecuting a peaceful and regulated community, wasting Federal resources in using a series of threatening tactics to shut down regulated access to medical cannabis across the state of California, the resolution\xa0says.In an interview released earlier this week inRolling Stone\xa0magazine, Obama claimed that there havent been any prosecutions of medical marijuana patients, but that hasnt impressed Americans for Safe Access Executive Director Steph Sherer.With a highly contentious bid for the White House, Obama should think twice about being out of step with his party and the 80 percent of Americans who support safe and legal access to medical marijuana,\xa0she said.(Source: sinidentidades-blog, via pieceinthepuzzlehumanity-deacti)\n\n \n\n2AM\n\nI am Trickster: The Wolf and the Raven\nthetricksterisme:There once was a girl who thought herself a wolf.She taught herself to walk on all foursShe loved her meat redShe removed her self outside of doorsShe slept with stars above her headThere was once a boy who thought himself a raven.He climbed a tree and made a nestHe loved pretty thingsHe(Source: thetricksterisme-blog)\n\n \n\nApril302012\n\n\t\t\t\tThe killing of U.S. troops by their ostensible allies in the Afghan military now make up 20 percent of all the U.S. combat deaths this year. Somehow, though, we never hear that the Afghan soldier who turns his gun on a U.S. soldier has \xe2\x80\x9csnapped\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 that maybe he has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), that maybe he was so enraged because he saw his baby daughter killed in a drone strike the night before and he lost control. No, we only hear that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Taliban must have infiltrated\xe2\x80\x9d the Afghan army or police. PTSD is apparently only for trained soldiers on our side. Except that in a 2009 UN-backed survey, the Afghan government\xe2\x80\x99s own Ministry of Health estimated that 66 percent \xe2\x80\x93 a full two-thirds \xe2\x80\x93 of the Afghan population, suffers from a variety of mental illnesses, most of them stress-related and including PTSD.\n\t\t\t\tPhyllis Bennisthose 2/3 of Afghans  something like 20 million people  face PTSD or other mental disorders with only FORTY-TWO psychiatrists and psychologists in the entire country.(via theamericanbear)(via pieceinthepuzzlehumanity-deacti)\n\n \n\n Older entries\nPage 1 of 13\n\nDesign by Brett Munro\n\n \n \n\n"
