Due to the extensive use of its tool by companies involved in Coronavirus research worldwide, the attack slowed down the research itself.\nPeople eagerly await any new development related to COVID-19 research, particularly vaccines and quick tests. Cybercriminals usually have other plans, and they often hit industries involved in critical tasks. Ransomware is often wielded in these situations because such organizations could be more inclined to pay the ransom.\nThe company didnt report the initial attack, and details only came to light in a New York Times report. Drew Bustos, ERTs vice president of marketing, admitted that the ransomware incident took place on September 20, after which they called security experts and notified the FBI.\neResearchTechnology makes software used in numerous clinical trials, including by companies actively working to develop Coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics. That includes IQVIA, an organization that manages AstraZenecas COVID vaccine trial, and Bristol Myers Squibb, a pharmaceutical company working to develop a quick test.\nBustos also said systems are finally coming back online and should be working in the coming days. This means that it took them more than two weeks to fix the problem. Its unclear whether the company paid the ransom or had other means to restore services.\nWhile the cybersecurity incident didnt stop the trials and therapeutics development, it likely prompted a slowdown. The ransomware attacks didnt affect other vaccine trials, like those of Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.\nUnfortunately, this is not the first time a cybersecurity incident has hindered COVID-19 vaccine development. Just a few months ago, law enforcement agencies including NCSC, CSE, DHS CISA and the NSA issued a joint advisory regarding recent activities of APT29 targeting organizations from the US, UK and Canada involved in COVID-19 research.\n\nTagsAstraZeneca covid-19 eResearchTechnology ERT IQVIA Johnson & Johnson Pfizer vaccine \n \n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry News\nCOVID-19-Related Emails Remain Prevalent in Phishing Campaigns\n4 hours ago\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry News\nCISA and FBI Observed APT Groups Targeting State Networks Related to US Election Systems\n1 day ago\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Privacy  Industry News\nMorgan Stanley Receives $60 Million Fine for Improper Handling of Customer Data\n1 day ago\n\n\n \n\n\nAbout the authorView All Posts\n\n\n \n\nSilviu STAHIE\nSilviu is a seasoned writer who followed the technology world for almost two decades, covering topics ranging from software to hardware and everything in between.
