The government has announced \xc2\xa330 million will be divided up between local authorities to help them fund dedicated staff who will make sure people follow coronavirus guidelines \xe2\x80\x93 such as wearing masks, checking businesses are following the rules and encouraging social distancing. Guidelines will be published today on what the covid-19 secure marshals can and cannot do. A government statement says the stewards can \xe2\x80\x93 ask businesses and people to follow government guidance, visit businesses to check they if are following the rules, manage queues outside shops and restaurants, encourage social distancing in crowded areas, ask people to wear face coverings and clean touchpoints. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  All marshals should be trained by the council. And they should not enforce social distancing, issue fines, engage physically with members of the public or decide if people can enter a venue. The full list of advice and breakdown of funding was published on Thursday. North Yorkshire Police is also set to get \xc2\xa3291,987 from government to step up their work enforcing coronavirus guidance. The money could also be used to make sure people are self-isolating when they are advised to.YorkshireLiveFollow @yorkshireliveMore OnYorkNorth Yorkshire PoliceCoronavirusPoliticsNorth
