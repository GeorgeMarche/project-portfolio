more about their friendship than they expected.\n"SEPULVEDA is a film of remarkable, touching intimacy. A modern-day road movie in which the road is only about 40 miles long, it presents a portrait of bonding and friendship through the smallest, most casual of details. I was mesmerized by the trio of terrific actresses at the center of the film, who never feel like they\'re giving performances: I genuinely felt like I was eavesdropping on real conversations."\n-Bilge Ebiri, Village Voice\n"Vibrating with authenticity, SEPULVEDA makes the viewer the fourth passenger in a WOC-led buddy road trip exploring not only Los Angeles geography and economics, but the dynamic anxiety of young adulthood at a crossroads. Culturally specific in ways not often seen on screen, the film\'s themes still manage to feel universal."\n--Jennifer L.
