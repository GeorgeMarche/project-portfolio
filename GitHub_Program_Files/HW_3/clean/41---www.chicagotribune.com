J.B. Pritzker\'s restrictions that were put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. (E. Jason Wambsgans / Chicago Tribune)             Orland Park has dropped a federal lawsuit against Gov. J.B. Pritzker challenging restrictions put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to court filings.     The village and other plaintiffs in the case had filed the complaint in mid-June, and last month told the judge overseeing the case it planned to file an amended lawsuit by this Thursday.

Mayor Keith Pekau said Thursday that the Village Board decided in a closed session following Monday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting to drop the case, but defended the village\xe2\x80\x99s use of taxpayer money to pursue the litigation.

Other plaintiffs in the lawsuit included two village residents and the co-owner of an Orland Park business, The Brass Tap.          The lawsuit alleged that state-imposed restrictions ordered by Pritzker beginning in March in response to the pandemic violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the U.S. Constitution and that Pritzker overstepped his authority.     The lawsuit argued, in part, that Pritzker had "failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that public health is significantly endangered without\xe2\x80\x9d restrictions on businesses and residents.

Wood ruled the village and other plaintiffs failed to show they have been unduly harmed by the governor\xe2\x80\x99s order and would have "a negligible likelihood of success\xe2\x80\x9d in pressing their claims.          Pekau said that the village\xe2\x80\x99s early September motion indicating it planned to file an amended lawsuit was a way of giving village officials more time to ponder its options.     \xe2\x80\x9cWe were trying to see what was happening out there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.     The mayor said he did not know how much the lawsuit cost the village, but that he believed the complaint put pressure on the governor to relax restrictions on businesses, which allowed Orland Park businesses to reopen. He said he believed the sales tax revenue flowing into village coffers would more than offset the legal expenses.
