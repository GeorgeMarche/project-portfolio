Some years ago it was decided that senior managers were not running prisons properly. KEY PERFORMANCE TARGETS were born. This method, much like payment by results, expected that certain targets were met before the government released money for the prison to operate for another year. The devil is always in the detail.\nMDT\nMandatory Drug Testing is the system that chooses prisoners at random to be vigorously tested for drugs in their system. Drugs in prison are a problem so it was decided to use the KPT system to reduce drugs in prison. The powers that be set a target of no more than 10% of prisoners failing an MDT as a KPT.\nPay attention at the back.\nMay I introduce Old Fred. He is not a real person but he represents a type of prisoner found in every establishment. Old Fred hates drugs and everything about them so naturally he and his like are tested for drugs fairly regularly under the MDT system and the prison meets its 10% KPT and gets paid for another year. You\xe2\x80\x99re shocked? Get over it, things get much worse.\nManagers are now aware that the most important thing they can do with their day is to chase KPT\xe2\x80\x99s and ensure that the prison gets money for next year. Is there a cost? Yes, these managers should be running the prison not scribbling rubbish on dry marker boards but who cares about running a prison \xe2\x80\xa6 We\xe2\x80\x99re meeting our KPT\xe2\x80\x99s what can possibly go wrong?\nBuckets and Mops\nA colour code is used for mops and buckets, green, blue and red equipment ensures that a toilet mop will never be used in a food prep area. Perfect sense.\nSome idiot decided that a Key Performance Target would be that only red mops would be stored in red cupboards, blue in blue, green in green etc.\nNow may I introduce you to the bizarre world of Stores. The first thing a stores manager ever said to me was Stores are for storing, not for issuing. The most wonderful thing a stores manager ever said to me was we ordered 100 red mops, 100 blue mops and 100 green mops but we received 300 green mops, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get on. Next day a clipboard appeared at the wing gate and standing behind it was a Governor. He saw Green mops in the toilet areas, green mops in the kitchen areas and green mops on the wing floor. He exploded and had a small emotional meltdown. Ten cons tried to stifle laughter and KPT\xe2\x80\x99s destroyed what little credibility that man had.\nPayment by results and KPT\xe2\x80\x99s are an admission that the world is a complex place, far too complex for most of us but rather than do nothing\xe2\x80\xa6. we\xe2\x80\x99ll do something odd.\n\n \n\n\n5 Comments \n\n\n\n\nJanuary 7, 2012\nPrison Healthcare Departments\n\n\n\n\nPrison Healthcare departments are brilliant, let me explain;\nIn the community, any doctor will tell you, they have a core group of drug related patients who attend and try to extort medication. These people are drug dependent and look to their local GP for top-up meds such as pain relief or anti depressants. The same patients will also often be on methadone and some will be\xc2\xa0using street drugs. This lifestyle makes the patient vulnerable to a spell in prison.\nOn arriving in prison the first stop is healthcare. Much is made of the bad back or depression and the prisoner will often have a list of medication he currently gets from his doctor on the outside. The prison doctor will generally declare the patient fit and not in need of further meds. \nAll hell breaks loose. \nAlarm bells are pushed and the prisoner struggles with up to three prison officers like a professional wrestler. He then starts a losing battle with the system. A drug user in a normal GP practice who turns up demanding additional medication is probably one in a couple of hundred patients. The doctor tries hard but with time constraints will often give in to some if not all of the demands. In prison this type of patient is one in three and the system is in place to deal with the drama. The lengths prisoners will go to are amazing, rooftop protests, food refusal, assault and seg are most common but eventually they get on the methadone programme, reduction not maintenance, they do their rattle and take one of two routes.\n\nThey get off the gear or they use the heroin available in prison with all the appalling consequences that brings.\nWorking solidly within this chaos are the brilliant doctors and nurses of the prison healthcare department. They say no on a daily basis, they are threatened and sometimes assaulted. They stand in front of people who have made some bad life choices and tell them the bad news, the consequences. On top of this healthcare are pulled in to every prison operation to observe, cell extractions, rooftop protests, self harm incidents, removals to segregation are all attended by healthcare. \nThe mental health side of their workload is large and growing. From clear mental illness to subtle personality disorders healthcare are in attendance. They talk to and support people who have almost no perception of reality as I know it then feedback to me in a way I understand. \nLastly gallows humour. You want a guaranteed good night out on the piss with great company?Healthcare..Want to know where to be told the best jokes? Healthcare.Want to know who\xe2\x80\x99s gossiping about you and what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying? Healthcare.. Whats the diagnosis Nurse? Theres not a pill big enough.The most committed chainsmoking cigarette addicts, Healthcare\nIf you know someone who works in a prison healthcare department buy them a drink, smile at them and make sure they are OK. You know one of the hardest working people in the country.\n\n\n \n\n\n3 Comments \n\n\n\n\nNovember 22, 2011\nWhy prisoners blame prisons for making them Heroin addicts.\xa0Blog.\n\n\n\n\nOne might reasonably expect that a secure place like a prison would be free from drugs. This is not the case, all drugs are available in prison and most assaults and violence are a direct result of this fact.\nTo understand why prisoners blame the service for making them drug addicts\xe2\x80\x99 let me first explain the testing regime and the prisoner perceptions of it.\nTwo types of drug tests are carried out in prison;\nVDT Voluntary Drug Test\nA VDT is a test that is conducted between the offender and the prison by agreement. A prisoner may make a choice to not partake in drugs while in prison and the VDT system will randomly test them and document the results. The offender can then produce the results as proof of their abstinence from drugs at, for example, a parole hearing.\nMDT Mandatory Drug Test.\nThe MDT is a compulsory test, which can be administered to any prisoner at any time. The prison service expects that every offender has no contact with illegal drugs during their prison sentence. An MDT is a urine test which checks for various drugs. Failing an MDT will generally result in 28days added to an offenders sentence.\nWhy then do these systems result in offender\xe2\x80\x99s accusing the service of making them drug addicts? It is generally believed among offenders that cannabis will show on a test for up to 28 days. Heroin, on the other hand, will only show for three days, that is to say that your body will filter out heroin in three days.\nOffenders therefore argue that the system encourages them to take heroin because it\xe2\x80\x99s filtered out of their system quicker than marijuana and they are therefore less likely to fail an MDT and have days added to their sentence.\nThe option of not taking drugs is always presented by officers and of course many prisoners get through their sentence without taking drugs at all.\n\n\n\nLeave a Comment \n\n\n\n\nNovember 17, 2011\nPrison Officers understand right and wrong, Legal Representatives understand winning and losing.\xa0Blog.\n\n\n\n\nPrison Officers understand right and wrong, Legal Representatives understand winning and losing. Discuss.\nPRISON OFFICERS\nGov, how can you do this job?\nMany years ago a Headteacher said to me fundamentally, people are good and it\xe2\x80\x99s turned out to be true. Strangers I\xe2\x80\x99ve met throughout my life have been given the benefit of the doubt and mostly come up trumps. I believe you should be able to lean a bike against a shop window and find it there when you come out. Your car should have as many windows in it as when you parked it and your house should not have to be like Fort Knox to keep burglars out. I agree with the laws of this country, including the right to be free from sexual or physical assault. If you cross these laws you will go to jail and I will lock the door every night with a clear conscience.\nWhat about those who are innocent?\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know who they are. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to get in to prison, if anything most people should go to prison long before they get their first sentence but the bottom line is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t meet many people that claim to be innocent. Of those who claim innocence most are arguing that the exact conviction is wrong. Yes, they were there and involved but the exact conviction is wrong. Unlucky kid.\nWhat if they\xe2\x80\x99re mentally ill?\nDifficult, I am aware of quite a number of prisoners whose mental health behaviour has been interpreted as criminal because the other option of using a Section of the Mental Health Act to hold then assess is no longer available due to resource issues. If this response was used against you it might take the following course. You\xe2\x80\x99re having dinner with friends in a lovely restaurant when an ulcer in your stomach bursts. You wretch and spray some blood from your mouth. Instead of an ambulance, the police turn up and arrest you for criminal damage to the restaurant carpet and you go to prison. Replace ulcer with mental health problem and you have the mental illness route into custody. So how can I lock them up? It\xe2\x80\x99s easy, most people in this situation are homeless when not in prison so its good to give them 3 meals and somewhere warm to be. Also, behind the illness is the personality and I\xe2\x80\x99m lucky enough to be working with some people who are frankly a bit of a laugh. I\xe2\x80\x99m working to try and ensure they don\xe2\x80\x99t hit the streets on release so it\xe2\x80\x99s not ideal but it\xe2\x80\x99s moving on.\nLEGAL REPRESENTATIVES\nI told that idiot on the switchboard I\xe2\x80\x99d be here at 10 now where\xe2\x80\x99s the prisoner?\nMost of my dealings with legal representatives come when I supervise legal visits. The quote above was fairly unusual in its rudeness but fairly common in reflecting an underlying attitude of mild contempt from legal reps to prison officers. One of the reasons for this is simple. Prisoners often portray officers as brutal violent thugs when in conversation with Legal Reps. I know this because they will go for the double whammy and speak of officer brutality in a loud voice to gain lawyer sympathy and officer anger. The drip drip of prisoner accusations is never balanced with any conversations with officers therefore the view of officers becomes negative.\nLegal representatives have no moral compass at all.\nBefore you jump all over me hear me out. Appearing in court is a process devoid of morality. Has the prosecution got a case? Can they present it without falling into a trap? Was the investigation conducted properly? Was the evidence handled properly? Is this the correct charge? Is the paperwork complete and legal?\nI suggest, for the purpose of this discussion, that Legal representatives adopt a position of neutral morality for their job. You don\xe2\x80\x99t ever ask if this defendant is a danger to society because it\xe2\x80\x99s not your job. Sometimes, legal people go into an area akin to hell. Rape victims being grilled in the witness box for hours in the hope they disintegrate as a person or the Dowler family being put on trial in the faint hope that Bellfield might see their resolve weaken and he gets away with murder. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that I see an alternative but I am saying that as a prison officer I have a clear moral compass while as legal representatives you don\xe2\x80\x99t have that luxury and I wonder what that does to you, how you manage the problem or indeed if you think there is a problem at all.\n\xe3\x80\x80\n\n\n\n6 Comments \n\n\n\n\nNovember 16, 2011\nThe cost of prison. Smoke and mirrors.\xa0Blog.\n\n\n\n\nThe big debate within the prison service today is privatisation of prisons or prisons for profit.\nTwo reasons are given for this practice, to reduce re-offending rates, and cost.\nCost is today\xe2\x80\x99s issue and what a prisoner costs society every year should be an easy and accurate business but no, this is far from true.\nI am most indebted to a fellow tweeter for this link, it\xe2\x80\x99s a parliamentary business publication where Sadiq Khan asks Crispin Blunt how much each prisoner costs the public purse per annum. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it was buried but it was the question just before the Werrity questions earlier this year. I will challenge these figures but first I must excuse myself from becoming too public.\nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111031/text/111031w0002.htm\nOn remembrance day I tweeted this;\nPrison_Screw Prison Officer\nToday I also remember those my family lost in 2 wars fighting for freedom to speak Yet I sit behind a nom-de-plume, wary of the authorities.\nThis sticks in my throat but until further notice I will not be identifying myself.\nThe cost issue.\nI know how much my prison costs to run, exactly how much. It includes education, maintenance, food, officer wages, civvy wages, laundry, landscaping, everything every last nut and bolt. Things are so tight that kitchens will cook exactly the number of meals as we have prisoners. If food gets spoilt there is nothing to replace it and I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost count of the times a prisoner has stood in my face, furious that he has no food, it\xe2\x80\x99s not his fault and I can do nothing about it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a daylong obstacle course to get hold of a packet of j-cloths missing from our wing order. The financial squeeze has been here for 18 months or more.\nImagine my surprise to find in the parliamentary answer that my prison is being shown as costing a bit under \xc2\xa310,000 PER PRISONER MORE to run than in reality. This has the effect of suggesting that we cost about \xc2\xa35million more to run than we do. Based on this incorrect information politicians will offer private companies large amounts of public money to run prisons. We will be tied-in to contracts that have few penalties for poor performance and in reality little in the way of expectations from the private provider.\nCynics among us will look to the SERCO shares held by so many MP\xe2\x80\x99s. Public money injected into SERCO increases the share price and injects money into the pockets of shareholders. \nWe can\xe2\x80\x99t have a debate about private prisons vs public prisons unless;\n \xe2\x80\x9cFigures\xe2\x80\x9d are replaced with \xe2\x80\x9cfacts\xe2\x80\x9d\nand politics and dogma are replaced with informed debate and common sense.\n\n\n\nLeave a Comment \n\n\n\n\nNovember 7, 2011\nIdiots guide to making money from drug addicts in\xa0prison.\n\n\n\n\nIdiots guide to making money from drug addicts in prison.\nSome will say this is a cynical view of privatised drug services in prison. The bottom line is that to make a profit from drug users in prison no actual drug addicts get helped because they are complex, needy and addicted often with a history of failing to get away from the drug culture. They can be helped but its hugely expensive, much more expensive than the government is prepared to pay so let\xe2\x80\x99s not take that risk. Always remember that the addicts family, those he loves and who love him, have failed to get him off the drugs so a smiling drug worker twice a week for an hour each time followed by a bit of a course\xc2\xa0is unlikely to do much better.\nPrivate drug agencies in prisons are businesses, they are duty bound to read and understand a set of criteria published by the people who pay the bills, in this case HMP on behalf of the government of the day. The rules of this game are simple and easy to understand.\nEstablish who are\xc2\xa0the prisoners with a drug history.\nProvide them with a course to stop them taking drugs.\nOn release from prison monitor them for a specified period of time to ensure they are drug free.\nIf successful send a bill to the government for a large amount of public money.\n1) Finding the right prisoners with a drug history is crucial to the business being successful. Attend the wings and speak to the prison staff, you are looking for sensible middle aged guys with a nice little Death by Dangerous Driving conviction or Fraud. Once found invite them for an interview. You are looking for a drug history so dont be put off. Are you taking drugs? No keep going, keep talking to them. Eventually they will tell you about a party they attended in Neasden in 1988 where they smoked some marijuana and didnt like it. Go to the paperwork and tick the box entitled Drug history established\n2) Advise the prisoner that you will be putting him on a drug awareness/ reduction course. Tell him how this will be seen positively by the parole board and will help him get the earliest possible parole date. Tell him he just has to pass the course and you will help him to progress through his sentence. Make sure he understands two things, firstly that his successful participation in the course will significantly help his ambition for an early release. Secondly while nobody expects him to pretend he is a drug addict, any mention that he really never takes drugs will be \xe2\x80\x9cunhelpful\xe2\x80\x9d.\n3) Assuming the prisoner successfully completes the drug course he will eventually be due for release so get fully involved in his release plan. Be sure to demand regular piss tests (drug screening tests) during the licence period and make sure everyone knows you want to be copied into the results. Be a snooty pain in the arse (optional) which might help avoid the difficult conversation when prison staff tell you they dont consider this prisoner has any drug issues.\n\xa0\n4) With the prisoner drug free for the duration of his licence you can now issue a hefty bill to HMP and the government. Dont forget to send the statistics to the politicians who will happily stand up in Parliament and promise that hardened drug users are getting off drugs due to the private drug initiative set up by them blah blah blah \xe2\x80\xa6\n\xc2\xa0\nThe people I feel sorry for in this mess are the publicly funded drug counselling teams (CARAT Teams) who are presently working with actual drug addicts in prison and because of their hard work and dedication\xc2\xa0is occasionally having an actual success. Their statistics don\xe2\x80\x99t shape up to the sham statistics of the private sector and are being used to \xe2\x80\x9cprove\xe2\x80\x9d how badly we need private companies.\n\n\n\n3 Comments \n\n\n\n\nNovember 5, 2011\nIPP SENTENCES; A VIEW FROM THE WING\xa0LANDING\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\nIPP A view from the landings.\nIPP Indeterminate for Public Protection.\nFrom an officers point of view this is a nightmare situation. Give a prisoner a life sentence with a low tariff (often under two years) and almost no way of securing a route out of prison. Add to this the propensity of IPP prisoners to have mental health issues or personality disorders and the fact that nearly all IPP prisoners drift wildly over tariff, the result is conflict. Lashings of it.\nI have acted as personal officer to a number of IPP prisoners but Ive only seen one move on. He had no discernible mental health issues, he found out what he needed to do, got his head down and got it done. He was released near tariff. This strategy is wildly out of reach for most IPP prisoners.\nBeing blunt about IPP sentences it seems that a persons mental health issue will reflect itself in their crime. Levels of violence will be excessive or bizarre, crimes themselves will be unusual or odd. A feature of the IPP prisoners I have dealt with is how very few crimes have a profit or monetary gain ambition. Most prisoners tell of very dramatic situations, fake guns, fire, hostages, churches, fear and attention. Very few speak of robbery or theft or money.\nYou cant speak of IPP sentences without mentioning Joseph Hellers book, Catch22. I am reminded of one particular incident in the book that relates so closely to IPP.\nIf you want to see the base Major you may wait in his waiting room only when he is not in his office. When the Major is in his office you may not wait in his waiting room to see him.\nThe Catch22 for IPP prisoners runs something like this;\nYou will be considered for release when you have completed certain courses and shown acceptable behaviour. The courses dont run anymore and the secret behaviour passwords are Not Mentally Ill Anymore\n\xa0\n\n\n\n5 Comments \n\n\n\n\nOctober 24, 2011\nA Funny Thing Happened on the way to D\xa0Wing\n\n\n\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that prisons are venues of regular laughter amid the noise, the tears and the blood.\nA couple of years ago I was leaning against a wall watching prisoners carrying lunch back to their cells when I heard a call of \xe2\x80\x9cscatter\xe2\x80\x9d. Naturally this is of interest to me as it usually involves an incident that needs dealing with. As a general rule I walk towards incidents because walking away risks something hitting you on the back of the head. Looking around I could see no incident but instead about ten smiling faces just staring at me. This was clearly not a challenge to authority but I had no idea what it was so we all stood in a smiling silence. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have a party\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a voice from behind me and the group, now about 20 strong, collapsed in gales of laughter. My years as a prison officer led me to believe something was going on, I needed to investigate.\nKISS is a prison officers first rule \xe2\x80\x9cKeep It Simple Stupid\xe2\x80\x9d so my investigation was direct, I asked \xe2\x80\x9cwhat?\xe2\x80\x9d and a voice shouted \xe2\x80\x9cShameless\xe2\x80\x9d and slowly the story emerged. It had been decided on the wing that I bore some resemblance to Frank from Shameless on Channel 4. I had never seen Shameless so the earlier clues flew over my head. This was not the first nickname I had been given since starting as a prison officer, in fact I consider myself to be rather over indulged in this area. Among my nicknames are; \xe2\x80\x9cROOOOOD\xe2\x80\x9d Roud Van Nistelroy, strange digerey-doo breathing or \xe2\x80\x9cROLF\xe2\x80\x9d Rolf Harris, horse noises during my \xe2\x80\x9cMr Ed\xe2\x80\x9d phase and one unhelpful reference to the late great actor Cardew Robinson.\nThese nicknames come and go but \xe2\x80\x9cFrank\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cScatter\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have a party\xe2\x80\x9d had taken on a life of their own and were clearly going nowhere so I decided to investigate. I told my wife the story and she, as a watcher of Shameless, burst out laughing. That night we sat down to watch Shameless together, \xe2\x80\x9cis that Frank?\xe2\x80\x9d I kept asking, not yet. Then a somewhat dirty crazy greasy haired idiot appeared \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s him\xe2\x80\x9d said the wife. I was less than impressed.\nNext day on the wing I gathered together the \xe2\x80\x9cnickname group\xe2\x80\x9d and gave them a tongue-in-cheek bollocking for likening me to a tramp like figure. \xe2\x80\x9cAh but Gov\xe2\x80\x9d said one prisoner, \xe2\x80\x9cHe has a lovely wife\xe2\x80\x9d\nFinally if you see someone who vaguely reminds you of Rood, Rolf, Mr Ed, Cardew and Frank say hello, It\xe2\x80\x99ll most likely be me.\n\n\n\nLeave a Comment \n\n\n\n\nOctober 22, 2011\nStatement of purpose.\n\n\n\n\nMaking money from running a private prison is not difficult.
