It is possible to complete standalone modules and then apply to transfer to an MSc/PGDip/PGCert qualification. Any time spent on the CPD route counts toward the time-limit a student has to complete their chosen qualification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching\nThe course is taught entirely online. Teaching methods include video, podcasts and web lectures. \nOur teaching combines three key elements:\nAuthentic learning: we use real-world, real-life, up-to-date case studies, examples and scenarios. You can immediately see how your learning is "authentic" and applicable to your own working life\nSocial learning: We learn from each other as much as from purely independent study. This course uses multiple tools to deliver content and facilitate interaction with and between tutors and students\nFlexibility: The majority of the online reading materials are heavily supplemented with videos, screencasts, internet-based materials, and the use of interactive online tools. Materials are provided in blocks or "sessions" of usually 2-3 weeks duration.\n\n\n\nAssessment\nAssessment is by coursework and online exams.\n\n\nDuration\nMPH or PG Diploma: 2 years, part-time\nPG Certificate: 1 year, part-time\n\n\nYour career\nOur public health masters graduates go on to work in very diverse areas, although many find work in a health or public health setting. Of particular note is that a significant percentage go on to undertake further doctoral/PhD study or to work in research or academic settings, which we feel reflects the quality of our research-led teaching in preparing and inspiring students.\nRecent graduates from our public health course are now working in the UK, in information analyst roles, in senior public health management positions, in health promotion activities, researching in universities, and as public health specialist in the local authority and in the NHS. Internationally, students have found excellent opportunities in governments, health departments, universities, hospitals, as well as non-governmental organisations, undertaking leadership roles, public health programme interventions and evaluations, research, and policy-making.\n\n\nEntry requirements\n2:1 honours degree, or a medical degree or significant experience in public health.\n\n\nEntry requirements for international students\n\n\n\n\nEnglish language requirements\nOverall IELTS score of 6.5 with a minimum of 6.0 in each component, or equivalent.\n\n\nOther English language qualifications we accept\n\n\n\n\n\nFees and funding\n\nFinancial information for postgraduate taught courses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Apply\n  \n\n\nYou can apply for postgraduate study using our Postgraduate Online Application Form.
