Six lads, all aged 19, had to quarantine at their house share in Selly Oak following two initial positive coronavirus cases on September 23.  Economics student Zack Cohen said his pals - Louis Shaw, Rafi Jacobs,\xc2\xa0Michael Abram and two others - said they then all contracted the virus, but are due to complete their isolation this weekend. The undergraduate compared their situation to feeling like they were living their lives in a "cage." He said tensions sometimes ran high as the group crave a "sense of normality" back in their lives. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZack Cohen cleaning the house share in Selly Oak, which he has been isolating in since September 23\n\n "We were all really excited to get to uni. It\'s like an escape from reality, but it\'s been the opposite," Zack told BirminghamLive. "We\'ve all be really careful, but we\'ve still managed to catch coronavirus. It\'s very frustrating as we remember what uni was like last year. It\'s now been the complete polar opposite to 2019. "At first it was quite fun to isolate with your mates for two-weeks. We were told we had to isolate and started watching a few movies and had a darts board and we were playing Fifa tournments on the PlayStation and Xbox.  \nRead More\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n307 students at University of Birmingham test positive for Covid-19\n\n \nRead More\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\nSecond Birmingham university hit by coronavirus - recording 130 cases\n\n  "Two of my mates tested positive first, then they got ill and were in their rooms. And four others were negative. But we all had to isolate. "They were stuck in their rooms and we had to bring breakfast, lunch and dinner to them. It was hard for them." Zack explained that soon all the lads contracted the virus with their isolation not ending until this weekend. "Two more then tested positive, so it was four of us were stuck in our rooms and then the other two tested positive - so we all had it," he added. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  "I was the fourth person from my house to get it." Zack said he had a high fever and lost his sense of taste and smell. He got a test from a testing site, which is on campus grounds. The lads relied on the kosher delivery service from the deli and ordered takeaways, while pals also dropped food packages outside their student digs. But the challenging seclusion has given the group a greater sense of appreciation for life - and they can\'t wait to get to the pub to watch some football. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  He added: "I appreciate things so much more now - like going out and playing football. Going to the pub. All the small things you take for granted. "We\'re looking forward to going to the pub together to watch the football and hopefully get some sort of normality back in our lives."birmingham.liveFollow @birmingham_liveMore OnUniversity of BirminghamSelly OakCoronavirus\n\nNewsallMost ReadMost RecentCoronavirusThe 18 reasons Birmingham households can mix indoors from Wednesday under tier 2 lockdownBirmingham and other parts of the West Midlands, including Sandwell and Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton, are all included in the tier two lockdownThe nine parts of West Midlands where you can still mix in pubsCoronavirusThe news came as a crushing blow to plenty across the city, with other areas in the West Midlands joining Birmingham in the second tierBirmingham lockdown rules explained - what you can and cannot do in Tier 2Birmingham LockdownIt can be confusing to know what\'s allowed under the Government\'s new three-tier system - check our list of the latest restrictions to see how life will changeSolihull sales director finds love on Channel 4\'s Married at First SightSolihullBoth Shareen and David \'fancy the pants off each other\'Emotional reunion as stolen dog Coco comes home after being \'bundled into waiting car\'WorcestershireChris Pearce, his wife and three kids were elated when West Mercia Police reunited them with their stolen Sprocker - against all the oddsDudleyStark warning Dudley could face stricter Covid restrictions in \'just a week\'The leader of Dudley Council said residents "must not be complacent"Car crashes into railings next to Audi dealership in WolverhamptonWolverhamptonA car smashed into the barriers near the Audi forecourt on Ring Road St George\'s1st Class Turkish Barbers issued strict Covid-19 warning after \'ignoring the law\'SandwellStaff and customers at 1st Class Turkish Barbers in Long Lane, Blackheath were found not wearing face masksCCTV appeal after thieves swipe Playstation 4, cash and trainers in Sutton Coldfield robberyAdidasWest Midlands Police are investigating the burglary on Boldmere RoadPictured - Drama student who killed Sutton Coldfield granddad after \'chance meeting\' in pubWest Midlands PoliceRhys Reynolds was found guilty of the manslaughter of 72-year-old Tony McCorryMost ReadMost RecentDudleyKingswinford crash victims named as Lucy, Izzie and Josh in tributes left by devastated friendsA man and two teenagers were killed when a yellow Skoda Fabia hit a tree in Bromley LaneThe 18 reasons Birmingham households can mix indoors from Wednesday under tier 2 lockdownCoronavirusBirmingham and other parts of the West Midlands, including Sandwell and Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton, are all included in the tier two lockdownRevealed: Ten big brands coming to Cannock McArthurGlen Designer OutletCannockTommy Hilfiger, Reiss, Kurt Geiger, Guess, Calvin Klein and Ted Baker will all have stores at the Midlands\' answer to Bicester VillageThe nine parts of West Midlands where you can still mix in pubsCoronavirusThe news came as a crushing blow to plenty across the city, with other areas in the West Midlands joining Birmingham in the second tierAston Villa star tipped to secure transfer amid Nottingham Forest linksNottingham Forest FCAston Villa midfielder has been linked with a return to the Championship and the former Arsenal youth could benefit from a fresh start and a Villa Park exit before Friday\'s transfer deadlineDudleyStark warning Dudley could face stricter Covid restrictions in \'just a week\'The leader of Dudley Council said residents "must not be complacent"Car crashes into railings next to Audi dealership in WolverhamptonWolverhamptonA car smashed into the barriers near the Audi forecourt on Ring Road St George\'sWest Ham discussing personal terms with Aston Villa transfer target - reportsAston Villa FCBrentford winger Said Benrahma has been heavily linked with a move to Villa as well as Premier League rivals Chelsea, Arsenal, Fulham and Crystal Palace and now looks set to move to West Ham\'Tweaked it\' - Injury update as loanee returns to West Brom treatmentWest Bromwich Albion FCWest Brom injury news - youngster Rayhaan Tulloch is back at Albion after a hamstring injuryBurnt out Skoda discovered as cops continue probe into fatal Telford shootingWest Mercia PoliceA 20-year-old man was shot dead at the Bridges Business Park in Horsehay\n\nTop StoriesCrash victims named as Lucy, Izzie and Josh in tributes left by devastated friendsDudleyA man and two teenagers were killed when a yellow Skoda Fabia hit a tree in Bromley Lane\'Send veggies\' - University of Birmingham students given Pot Noodles and ready meals while isolatingUniversity of BirminghamUndergrads across the country have been experiencing problems with food while self-isolatingStop and search increases in the West Midlands during lockdown West Midlands PoliceBetween April and June there was a rise in stop and searches across the region despite the lockdownCan I leave Birmingham during Tier 2 lockdown?
