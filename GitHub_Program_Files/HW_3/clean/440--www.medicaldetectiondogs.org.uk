Rest assured every enquiry is important to us and we will endeavour to respond to each one in time.\nWe are incredibly grateful for the donations we receive, which are more important now than ever because we predict fundraising activities will be affected, but it will also take us longer to thank you for those because of the reduction in the number of staff able to attend our Centre.\nAmong all the concerning news at this time, we will try to keep a steady stream of good news on our social media pages, to help remind us all of the amazing abilities of our life-saving dogs and their impact on the people they help, which we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do without the amazing support you give us. Follow us on Facebook @MedicalDetectionDogs, Twitter @MedDetectDogs and Instagram@medicaldetectiondogs\nThank you for your patience at this challenging time and please look after yourselves.\nThe MDD team\n \nPlease help with a donation\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nWays that you can help us to train more life-saving dogs\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nFundraise\n \nThere are lots of ways in which you can get involved and support us.\n \n\nFind out more\n\n \n\n\n\nPuppy sponsorship\n \nBy sponsoring a Medical Detection Dogs puppy, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be making a huge difference by helping to support their care and training.\n \n\nFind out more\n\n \n\n\n\nVolunteer\n \nVolunteers are essential to the work we do, providing help and support to vital services from socialising our puppies through to driving and working in the office.\n \n\nFind out more\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJoin the Medical Detection Dogs Welly Walk\nFrom now until October 31st\n \nAutumn has arrived.
