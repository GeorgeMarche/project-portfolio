Some programmes also have optional modules that can be selected to enhance your learning in certain areas and many feature a dissertation, extended report or research project to demonstrate your advanced learning.\nHuman Intelligence\nHuman intelligence, or HUMINT as it is more commonly referred to, is, perhaps, the first covert collection discipline, an activity deployed by States and organisations for thousands of years. The module examines the HUMINT collection discipline by introducing the range of both overt and covert techniques. It will critically evaluate its important contribution to identifying and mitigating threats while also considering the associated ethical challenges that come with HUMINT use. You will critically examine the use of HUMINT in different social and operational contexts including the use of juveniles as informants, the role of informants who participate in crime and the use of legal representatives as informants. The module, recognising that HUMINT is not simply the domain of the State, also examines\xa0its increasing use\xa0in the private sector and non-government organisations. While focusing on the covert aspect on HUMINT, the module also equip\xa0you with an in-depth knowledge of community HUMINT and its application and integration into covert operational settings.\nForensic Elicitation of Intelligence\nThe era of the War on Terror highlighted the central role played by intelligence agencies, law enforcement and the military in securing the necessary critical intelligence to identify and mitigate threat. It was also an era where some of the accompanying policies and practices adopted to elicit intelligence were subject to close public and governmental scrutiny. Increasing pressure to secure high quality and timely intelligence led to accusations of questionable ethical elicitation techniques. This module aims to introduce the array of academic research associated with the elicitation of intelligence. It explores those techniques that appear to be both effective and ethical in securing information to better understand and then mitigate threat and harm. The module will examine various interview models and techniques, which when correctly applied against witnesses, victims, refugees, prisoners or other detainees can effectively and ethically contribute to satisfying intelligence reporting requirements and progress investigations.\nCovert Techniques: Legislation and Operational Capability\nThis module examines the array of covert techniques routinely deployed against criminals, aggressive State and non-state actors. It critically evaluates the governing legislation and procedures relating to the deployment of covert techniques and will critically assess the debate on what is the appropriate balance between privacy and security. Youwill assess covert methods and technical equipment currently available to organisations and the relevant law, procedures and guidance governing their use in both reactive and proactive investigations. The module will critically evaluate the benefits and risks of managing the product from covert activities together with the authorisation processes, governance, and accountability in place.  It will also cover an often-overlooked area of study; the role of tasking and coordination models and senior leaders in covert operations.\nResearch Method\nThe generation of high-quality academic research is critical for the development of effective covert and intelligence practice. This module provides an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods, and the types of skills necessary for the planning, data gathering and writing a research proposal. It includes research design, methods of data collection and approaches to managing and analysing data. The module provides a basic understanding of the underlying principles of quantitative and qualitative research and the links between the two. It will\xa0help you to choose\xa0 the most appropriate research method to address a particular research question.  The module will be geared towards\xa0you completing the dissertation or an independent and original research paper, which may shape and influence future practice.\nCovert investigation and Specialist Intelligence Dissertation\nThe vocational nature of the postgraduate programme is further enhanced by the dissertation, which is particularly useful for working professionals who want to focus their efforts on a topic that has particular relevance either to their own work environment or one in which they may want to further develop their career. The dissertation enables\xa0you to investigate in-depth a topic within the field of Covert Investigation and Specialist Intelligence studies. You\xa0can select\xa0your own research area (subject to Programme Leader authorisation). The dissertation will include independent and original empirical research into policy and practice. It is expected that pertinent knowledge and skill gained in other course modules will be reflected in the dissertation. The dissertation allows you to undertake an independent and sustained piece of research into a substantive topic of your own choosing.\xa0It must include appropriate extended piece of empirical or theoretical research on a topic in the Covert Investigation and Specialist Intelligence studies field.\nOptional modules\nCase Studies in Intelligence Success and Failure\nA disastrous military failure leading to a costly retreat, a successful surprise attack by terrorists with catastrophic consequences to a civilian population, or the death of a vulnerable person even after multiple indications of threat had been previously received by law enforcement. All these tragic circumstances can lead to accusations of State intelligence failure. However, what is meant by intelligence failure? Can it be predicted? Can it be prevented? In contrast, what makes for an intelligence success and can this success be replicated?  This module examines the concept of intelligence failure using real-world case studies, exploring the theoretical approaches to explain failure, and then, apply these against cases drawn from the military, intelligence agencies, law enforcement and multi-agencies working. This module offers a long-term view of the history of intelligence and then drills down to specific case studies, issues, and areas whose lessons are vital to understanding modern intelligence concepts and practice. By doing so, it enhances\xa0your critical thinking regarding the challenges that arise through gathering, evaluating, securing and using intelligence.\xa0  \n\n\n\nOperational Ethics\nIntelligence professionals are employees of Governments and/or Business who operate in an area that some would consider unethical. Ethics play out for all ranks and grades in organisations that utilise covert methodology or collect intelligence. The norms that appears settled in the 1980s are now under scrutiny, with intelligence ethics now acting as a point of reference in public inquiries, both within the UK and further afield. Scandals involving intelligence agencies and law enforcement have led to growing demands for transparency and increased accountability. However, deception, secrecy and morally troubling compromises are often operationally necessary to mitigate risk and save lives. This module will focus on the ethical challenges arising from covert and specialist intelligence based operational practice and critically evaluate the dilemmas that may arise when someone is asked to perform a task that potentially interferes with the rights of others. Using case studies, this module examines how future operatives can best foster an ethical climate within their organisations and within the senior leadership team.\nIntelligence Analysis\nThe module considers what intelligence and analysis means in an operational context. It explores its overall role and its application to security related issues of law enforcement, governmental agencies, international organisations, and the private sector. It examines issues pertaining to the use of proactive intelligence and analysis and does so by  using real-world case-studies  which enables\xa0you to delve deeper into the nuanced variables that can both challenge analysts and also, enhance modern analytical practice.\nInvestigative Interviewing\nEffective interviewing is central to the success of both overt and covert investigation and accordingly, the highest standards of practice need to be upheld. It can identify both the guilt and innocence of people. It can support the prosecution case and, if effective, can increase public confidence. In this context, interviewees can include victims, witnesses, prisoners and suspects. Agencies, both private and State need to develop and maintain interview skills of their employees. Effective interviewing can assist with directing the interview. It can ensure they are undertaken ethically and are consistent with the rule of law. This module critically explores the intersection of psychology and policing and it does so by examining current practices, techniques and applications of police interviewing.\xa0You will be exposed to comparative international techniques in interviewing, interpretation of verbal and physical behaviour and the causes of denial, deception and defensiveness.\nDisclosure\nSecuring a successful prosecution while still being able to protect covert methodology and sensitive sources is critical for the long-term success of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. This module will critically examine the principles of disclosure, taking the student through a structured, methodical process, discussing common law principles that apply, the statutory law as set out in the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 and the supporting codes of practice. It will also explore the role and responsibilities of investigators, disclosure officers and the Senior Investigating Officer, the disclosure test contained within the legislation and the requirements placed on the prosecution and the defence.\xa0You will critically evaluate the common law rules of disclosure in the early stages of the investigation and prosecution case. There will be a focus on managing disclosure in complex cases, the scheduling and dealing with sensitive material, the application of Public Interest Immunity (PII) and considerations around third party material.\xa0You will also critically evaluate the legal and ethical considerations for investigators in managing criminal investigations and understanding the wider strategic issues faced by the Investigator including the role of the Prosecuting Authority.\nIntelligence Sharing and Cooperation\nThe failure to share information with others can undermine the effectiveness of operations and investigations, sometimes fatally. Even though the benefits of intelligence sharing have been well evidenced, this module will consider why information sharing still appears to be a recurring problem across agencies. This module explores how intelligence sharing mechanisms have developed over time, locally, nationally and internationally. It will critically assess the legislative provision underpinning the management of information and explore the barriers and enablers to effective sharing and cooperation within and across organisations.\nIntelligence Oversight Mechanisms\nThe 9/11 attacks, the terrorist attacks in London, the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, and the War in Iraq and the weapons of mass destruction have all led to inquiries into how the intelligence and law enforcement agencies collected, handled and used intelligence. This module examines the role of Intelligence oversight and its application at local, regional and national operating levels. This module will explore what effective oversight may look like and asks why is oversight so important to intelligence agencies and law enforcement.  It addresses\xa0other critical questions including; What happens if oversight is ineffective? What is the capacity and expertise required to deliver effective and meaningful oversight? What undermines effective oversight? The module critically examines and compares both UK and USA oversight mechanisms. It will show that legislative or parliamentary scrutiny, if undertaken effectively, can ensure intelligence agencies not only attract the resources required but can deploys these efficiently and ethically.  The module, recognising that scrutiny it not just the domain of the State, also examines the important role played by the media in oversight. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching\nAn insight into teaching on your course\nTeaching methods\nThe course is taught in a distance learning format, with no attendance required on campus.
