Like every other kid who adored men in costumes smashing cardboard cities and swatting toy planes and tanks, I couldn\'t get enough of the Kaiju Eiga. I was so used to seeing Godzilla as the hero that the first time I watched the Americanized Godzilla, King of the Monsters, I hid under my blanket due to being frightened by an admittedly tame monster movie on a weekend night as my Dad snored in his bed. It wouldn\'t be until my twenties that I would see the original and uncut Japanese Gojira, which is actually downright frightening compared to the Americanized version, that had eluded me for years. I grew to appreciate it even more as the nuanced social commentary was put back in, which was sorely missed in the Americanized version. And as the years go on, everyone would stare at me, perplexed that I, a grown man, still enjoyed Godzilla and other films of the same genre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood: A Melancholic Masterpiece\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Apps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 28, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the past decade or so, I admired Quentin Tarantino\'s movies quite a bit. Kill Bill being my entry point to his output, his movies excessively dark and cruel yet had a core of humanity within them while also being love letters to genre films of yore. How could I not love his movies? That is until recently, what with the scandals rocking Miramax, from Weinstein getting outed as a predator to the behind the scenes car crash on the set of Kill Bill to Tarantino\'s own controversy regarding his treatment of women characters and women in real life.\xa0 \nI realize that this is an odd way to start my review, considering I came away completely in love with his latest film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio as washed up former western TV star Rick Dalton who desperately trying to attempt at stardom with Brad Pitt as his stoic stunt double Cliff Booth who supports his friend while they struggle to see what\'s in store for them in the future.

Even Star Wars wasnt immune, what with spinoffs that were made to expand upon the already massive universe. And not surprisingly Godzilla and company are getting the Avengers treatment in the new movie from Warner Bros. and Legendary.  \nGodzilla: King of the Monsters, sharing the title to the Americanized version of Gojira, is a loud, bombastic, fanservicey, garish, overstuffed, and quite extremely silly. It is designed to be the most maximum Godzilla film ever. Gone is the quiet introspective nature from its predecessor, the moody atmosphere wherein humanity is merely a speck in an uncaring world \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalloween; Evil Returns Home\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Apps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 24, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrigger Warnings: mentions of rape\nThe 1978 horror classic is one of those films that slashed its way into the pop cultural zeitgeist of the time while jumpstarting the slasher boom (It is not, as some claim, the first slasher film. That dubious honor goes to such films as Blood and Lace, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Black Christmas, and A Bay of Blood or its much more cooler sounding title Twitch of The Death Nerve). As such Halloween, along with every other seminal piece of media released in its heyday, inevitably becomes imitated (read: plagiarized) so much so that when younger viewers or more genre savvy folks look at these works for the first time and ask what is so Goshdarn special about these movies to begin with.\nLooking back on the original, it almost seems quaint these days. The world is a different place in 2018 than it was in 1978. Flip on the TV news and you see Trump spouting dangerous falsehoods, confirming white nationalist views, and bragging about committing crimes t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady Player One; It\'s Pretty Good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Apps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 29, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI could start off this review by telling you that I was eight years old when I picked up my first NES controller, even younger than that when I watched my first Steven Spielberg film. I could wax on about many things from my childhood, the Godzilla Trendmaster toys I played with, the many 80s films that I have seen, the songs from that decade, the clothes, the trends, yadda yadda ad nauseam. But Im going to forgo all of that because its probably already being done and I would like to delude myself that I am being original in my review. After all, thats what youre here for, a review, not an index or trivia or list of things from decades ago.  \nThe discussion surrounding this film has been...a grind so to speak. From the idiotic, tone deaf takes like this film being the Black Panther for gamers (even as I write those words, I roll my eyes), to what constitutes "real cyberpunk," the extremely problematic stuff concerning the author and his book which Ive yet to read by t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPacific Rim Uprising; A Toy Commercial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Apps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 27, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the first film came out in 2013, I didnt know what to expect other than Hollywoods take on the kaiju genre. What I got was what Roger Ebert described as an out of body experience, when he first watched the first Star Wars film. Pacific Rim made me feel like I was ten years old all over again, jumping and cheering in front of the TV as Godzilla fought off his mechanical doppelganger, the walking arsenal MechaGodzilla, with the help of King Caesar, that veritable lion dog. Pacific Rim was infused with so much magic that it rises above you and towers over your imagination like its giant robots and giant monsters.  \nUnfortunately, the same cant be said for its 2018 follow up, Pacific Rim Uprising, starring John Boyega, Cailee Spaeny, Scott Eastwood, Adria Arjona, and Jing Tian, with Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, and Burn Gorman returning in their respective roles.  \nIm going to be frank here. Technical aspects here the film succeeds and the battles are good for what the genre demands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverdue Reviews!: Ghost in the Shell (2017); An Empty Shell of a Landmark Anime Film\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Apps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 16, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood grief, where do I even begin. The worst part about this movie isn\'t that it\'s bad so much as it is boring. It had potential to introduce Mamoru Oshii\'s anime masterpiece, along Masamune Shirow\'s manga that the former used as a blueprint. The reason I recall Oshii\'s anime film so fondly is because when I was a preteen otaku, the hype around this movie was too much for me to pass it up.\xa0I really did want to see this movie because I had heard it inspired The Matrix so I figure why not. And no, I didn\'t rent the film to satiate my hormonal urges like so many others of my generation did when they heard about this film because of the nudity. It was at first too impenetrable for a kid like me to understand it but I enjoyed it nonetheless and only upon rewatching it did I begin to really appreciate it for what it really was. I\'ve read the manga and I enjoyed the show as well, although in the end I prefer the moody and engrossing film because that\'s just m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlade Runner 2049; The Sequel Nobody Asked For And The One We Are Blessed With.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Apps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 16, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlade Runner 2049, the sequel to the cyberpunk cult classic Blade Runner, starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, takes place 30 years later as it follows up the events that transpired in the previous film. Gosling is the eponymous Blade Runner this time around, who goes by the name of K, and he stumbles upon a complex mystery that may have connections to his past. And that is all I am saying about this character because I wouldn\'t dare spoil what happens. Gosling has been accused of being nothing more than a wooden mannequin, being too stoic for leading man roles but, as is the case in Drive and The Nice Guys, he once again demonstrates his acting chops. It\'s the same sort of acting that Alain Delon and even his co-star use, low-key yet powerful acting. Harrison Ford makes a helluva comeback as the original Blade Runner himself, Rick Deckard, in a role that is much more than a walk on cameo. He gives us a great performance that could have just been mostly sardonic but he do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowered by Blogger\n\n\n\nTheme images by Radius Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKylo Ronin\n\n\n\n\nA writer trying to break out of his delusions of grandeur!
