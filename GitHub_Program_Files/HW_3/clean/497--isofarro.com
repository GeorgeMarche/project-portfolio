Luohu has its own border crossing; the LoWu station on the Hong Kong side, which is reachable via the Hong Kong train service. Todays route sees us taking a bus and a train to the border crossing, and a proper Shenzhen taxi to []\n\t\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\nFlash\'s slide into irrelevance\nisolani on Tue 24th March 2015\n\n\nI got a new Macbook Air a year ago. In the weeks I spent setting it up as my main work machine I made the deliberate decision not to install Flash. I figured I would hit a case where it became clear I needed Flash. A year later and I still don\'t have Flash installed.\nFlash is no longer an essential plugin on the desktop/laptop Web. It is non-existent on mobile. It is no longer the default way to consume video on the Web.\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\nWhat is internationalisation and localisation?\nInternationalisation Tips on Wed 25th June 2014\n\n\nWhen we talk about sites that can support multiple languages we talk about internationalisation (and its short form i18n). We also talk about localisation (l10n), and locale, language, and countries.\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\nGetting a Temporary Residence Permit in China\nGeek Trails on Thu 30th January 2014\n\n\n\t\tIn China, all foreigners are required by law to register for a temporary residence permit. The correct document name is Registration Form of Temporary Residence. The law requires foreigners (referred to as aliens) apply for a temporary residence permit within 24 hours of entering mainland Chinaor moving residences within China.

This high speed train reaches speeds in the excess of 300 kilometres per hour, covering the distance between Shenzhen and Beijing (2400 kilometres) in a little over 10 hours.

It is a diverse park, so there is something for everyone, from sedate and amusing 3D rides to insane looking rides that make bungee jumping look like a Sunday afternoon hair wash in the sink, and []\n\t\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\nFinding my way around Shenzhen\nGeek Trails on Sat 16th February 2013\n\n\n\t\tShenzhen doesnt have a London-like A-Z that I could find. And since its a relatively new city growing in leaps and bound, maps are very quickly going to be out-of-date, inaccurate, or missing useful travelling information (e.g. Metro stops). So I looked out for a few alternatives. Static digital maps At the most primitive, the [...]\n\t\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\nShenzhen to Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA)\nGeek Trails on Sat 16th February 2013\n\n\n\t\tI spent Thursday trying to figure out how to get from my hotel in Shenzhen to Hong Kong International Airport. Again, the ferry was a tempting route, but still too much uncertainty, and I didnt have the time to get to Shekou and scout around and recon, nor was I confident about my knowledge about [...]\n\t\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\nShenzhen Convention & Exhibition Centre\nGeek Trails on Wed 13th February 2013\n\n\n\t\tI spent this afternoon walking around the Shenzhen Convention and Exhibition Center. It is one of the most recognisable buildings in Shenzhen, and is the heart of Shenzhen. Its about five or six blocks from my hotel, but with the ongoing construction work there isnt a straightforward route to it. At least the Exhibition Tube [...]\n\t\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\nSplendid China Village\nGeek Trails on Wed 13th February 2013\n\n\n\t\tYesterdays successful Metro venture meant that today I could do the touristy thing.
