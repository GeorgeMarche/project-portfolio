My Facebook name that I choose to have is James Jimmy Cieloha. I have regulary been known as Jimmy Cieloha for a long time.  I know there are lots of guys whose first name is Jimmy choose to have their Facebook profile listing Jimmy as their first name including Jimmy Bunch.  I like Deborah Norville, Diane Sawyer, and Elizabeth Vargas reporting and doing the news.  I say that Deborah Norville is always better than Vanna White.  I say that Big Bird from Sesame Street is more friendly than Bob Barker from the old Price Is Right shows.  Dennis Basso on QVC is more friendly to the women than Bob Barker from the old Price Is Right shows.  I enjoyed seeing people with coats on all the time.  I like to make sure the Toyota drivers crashing and burning each weekend including the Joe Gibbs cars including Denny Hamlin, Kyle Busch and Joey Logano and hope none of them would try attempt to win the title each year.Favorite QuotesHA HA.
