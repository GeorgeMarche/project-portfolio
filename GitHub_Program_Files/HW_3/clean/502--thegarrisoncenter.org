Knapp Leave a commentPhoto by cottonbro from PexelsThe TL;DR on COVID-19: Panic, not science, continues to drive the public policy discussion.Here, such as it is, is the current science:If 100,000 Americans\xc2\xa0 age 19 or younger contract COVID-19, three of them will die.If 10,000 Americans between 20 and 49 years old contract COVID-19, two of them will die.If a thousand Americans between 50 and 69 years old contract COVID-19, five of them will die.But if youre 70 years or older and contract COVID-19, your chances of dying skyrocket to about 1 in 20.Those are the best estimates of COVID-19 Infection Fatality Ratios published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.If the CDCs estimates are correct  and if I had a nickel for every time Ive heard listen to the experts! Id need a bigger house to store my nickels in  a COVID-19 infection is less likely than a seasonal flu infection to kill anyone under 70.Theres a caveat, of course: CDC estimates COVID-19s R0 (the average number of people an infected person infects in turn) at 2.5, while seasonal flus R0 runs about half that. COVID-19 spreads more quickly and easily than flu. More cases equals more deaths.And theres an excuse: These are the numbers we have NOW, not the numbers we had when the pandemic hit. What we had THEN was uncertainty.But uncertainty isnt a very good excuse for shutting down significant portions of the US economy, driving unemployment up from one in 25 American workers to one in seven (its still nearly one in ten), and placing much of the population under house arrest.When we didnt know what was going on, panic wasnt the correct answer.Now that we have a better idea of whats happening, holding onto the visible vestiges of panic isnt the correct answer either. Its just a new, state-imposed religion.As late as a few months ago, the US regime condemned governments which require women to cover their faces in public.Now, American politicians command men and women alike to do so, and most Americans meekly submit  not because masks prevent the spread of COVID-19 (evidence for that claim is sketchy at best), but because politicians and the scientific bureaucratic priesthood live to issue orders and obeying those orders lets us feel like were doing something about COVID-19.Thus the masks, and the special magic social distancing formulae, and the ubiquitous Stay Home, Stay Safe signage. The Cult of the Omnipotent State is enjoying a periodic revival unlike any since 9/11.If the CDCs numbers are correct, they offer two lessons:First, protecting the elderly from COVID-19 as best we can makes sense.Second, the rest of us need to abandon the state-imposed superstitions and get back to living in the real world.Thomas L.
