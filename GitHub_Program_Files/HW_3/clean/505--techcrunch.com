But technology has opted to take a back seat to frontline workers and find ways to support them rather than attempt to solve the issues at hand.\nThe founders of tech-forward healthcare startups Color  and Carbon Health explained their approach in one panel, emphasizing that the startup mindset is a resilient and adaptable one.\nYoure seeing, I think, the distributed nature of the U.S., where at some point its clear that you cant wait for someone to solve your problem, so people just start jumping in and building the solution themselves, said Othman Laraki,  Colors CEO.\nHis company took on the issue of bottlenecks in the COVID-19 testing ecosystem, finding that with a few tweaks Color could contribute a considerable amount.\nWe realized that there were several assets that we could bring to bear, he said. We decided to build a platform to get around some of the logistical constraints and the supply chain constraints around COVID testing. We did that, got large-scale COVID testing lab online, but also repurposed a lot of our digital platforms for COVID testing \xe2\x80\xa6 I think were doing approximately 75% of all the testing in SF right now.\nCarbon Health  CEO Eren Bali noted that companies like theirs are important props at a time when the medical infrastructure of the country buckles under pressure.\n\nCarbon Health and Color founders see power in bringing healthcare to the edge\n\nAt this point the U.S. doesnt have the best public health system, but at the same time we have best-in-class private companies who can sometimes operate a lot more efficiently than governments can, he said. We also just recently launched a program to help COVID-positive patients get back to health quickly, a rehabilitation program. Because as you know even if you survive it doesnt mean your body was not affected, there are permanent effects.\nThis type of at-home care has become increasingly important, both to take pressure off hospitals and frontline workers and to improve accessibility to resources.\nSometimes the cost of care is a lesser problem compared to the access, said Laraki. Like if you need to drive for an hour and take time out of your day, etc., if youre an hourly worker. Thats what makes healthcare inaccessible. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
