Andrew M. Cuomo, which overlapped and contradicted each other. Schools and businesses that were to be shut down on one map were not on the other. The city, where the rules took effect on Thursday in parts of Brooklyn and Queens, made a searchable online database of addresses available so New Yorkers could determine which zone they were in.Two lawsuits were also filed on Thursday, one by an Orthodox Jewish group and the other by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, to stop the state from enforcing the governor\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions on houses of worship. The legal actions came after ultra-Orthodox Jews in the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn this week lit masks on fire and attacked an Orthodox reporter who has documented local resistance to social distancing.And in other Brooklyn neighborhoods like Bensonhurst and Windsor Terrace, parents rallied against the sudden closure of schools.The targeted lockdown, in place for two weeks, divides virus hot spots into three color-coded zones of red, orange or yellow, with nonessential businesses in the hardest-hit areas required to shut down. Restaurants and bars in a red zone, which has the most severe rules, can only offer takeout and delivery, just like in the spring. Houses of worship are limited to just 10 individuals, a number that coincides with the minimum requirements of a Jewish prayer service. After two weeks, Mr. de Blasio said Thursday that the city would work with the state to reassess whether a longer timetable were needed.\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a turnaround that, if we do it right, could only take a few weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. de Blasio said Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we don\xe2\x80\x99t do it right, it could go a lot longer.\xe2\x80\x9dToday we establish clear limits for areas where we see high positivity: The Cluster Action Initiative.Locations will be categorized either Red, Orange, or Yellow, based on proximity to the cluster.The severity of the problem will determine the response. pic.twitter.com/707FYGHB0g Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) October 6, 2020\nThe city shut down 61 public school sites on Thursday, he said; in total, 153 locations had been closed in the red and orange zones.Earlier in the week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that schools in nine ZIP codes in Brooklyn and Queens had to be closed for in-person instruction on Tuesday. But when the state released updated guidance, some of those schools fell into yellow zones, in which schools can remain open. Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday that 16 schools in those areas will remain closed for now.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep those schools closed too because the city believes fundamentally those schools have to be closed as part of the overall strategy,\xe2\x80\x9d the mayor said.City Hall officials were perplexed by the governor\xe2\x80\x99s new maps, and frustrated by their lack of clarity, but thankful that he had agreed to do something, a de Blasio administration official said. But the map files the state had given the city were flawed, two city officials said, with some geographic borders not corresponding to streets, leaving people to guess whether their schools or stores were required to close.Areas in N.Y.C.

Mr. Trump announced shortly before 1 a.m. on Friday, Oct. 2, that he and the first lady, Melania Trump, had tested positive for the virus; White House officials have declined to say when he last tested negative.He was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Friday afternoon. Officials initially described the president\xe2\x80\x99s symptoms as mild, but The Times and other news organizations reported Saturday that Mr. Trump had been administered supplemental oxygen because his blood oxygen dropped to a level that was concerning. His lung scans had \xe2\x80\x9cexpected findings,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Conley said on Sunday, although he declined to say what that meant.In the note on Thursday, Dr. Conley said that Mr. Trump has remained \xe2\x80\x9cstable\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdevoid\xe2\x80\x9d of symptoms that would suggest the illness was progressing.\xe2\x80\x9cSaturday will be day 10 since Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s diagnosis, and based on the trajectory of advanced diagnostics the team has been conducting, I fully anticipate the president\xe2\x80\x99s safe return to public engagements at that time,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Conley said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says those who test positive for the coronavirus should isolate themselves from others for a minimum of 10 days after testing positive, or for at least 10 days after symptoms first appear. Some people with a moderate or severe case of the virus can stay infectious for 20 days or perhaps even longer, according to the C.D.C.Shortly after Dr. Conley\xe2\x80\x99s memo, Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s re-election campaign released a statement calling for the second presidential debate to take place as originally scheduled. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is therefore no medical reason why the Commission on Presidential Debates should shift the debate to a virtual setting, postpone it, or otherwise alter it in any way,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement said.\xe2\x80\x94 Maggie HabermanAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMcConnell says he has avoided the White House for months because of the lack of virus precautions.VideotranscriptBackbars0:00/0:30-0:00transcriptMcConnell Says He\xe2\x80\x99s Avoided White House Over Lack of Virus MeasuresSenator Mitch McConnell said he had not been to the White House since August.Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been following, following the advice of the C.D.C. and the Capitol physician. I can tell you, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been to the White House since Aug. 6. And I personally didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel that they were approaching protection from this illness in the same way that I thought was appropriate for the Senate. And the Senate has been operating in a way that I think has largely prevented contraction of this disease.Senator Mitch McConnell said he had not been to the White House since August.CreditCredit...Anna Moneymaker for The New York TimesThe Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said Thursday that he had been avoiding the White House since midsummer because of concerns that officials there were not taking proper precautions to guard against the spread of coronavirus.\xe2\x80\x9cMy impression was that their approach to how to handle this was different from mine and what I insisted that we do in the Senate, which is to wear a mask and practice social distancing,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. McConnell told reporters.The Kentucky Republican said he had not visited the White House since Aug. 6, when he met with President Trump to discuss the status of negotiations over additional stimulus legislation.The decision appears to have been a prudent one now that the White House has become a virus hot spot, with Mr. Trump the most prominent to test positive for the virus and contract Covid-19, the disease.More than a dozen White House guests and employees, including two of Mr. McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s fellow Senate Republicans, were infected after attending an event Mr. Trump held last month to announce his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Mr. McConnell, who is leading the drive to confirm Judge Barrett, was noticeably absent from the largely maskless group gathering.The majority leader did not specifically comment on Judge Barrett\xe2\x80\x99s nomination ceremony.Though he has closely aligned himself with Mr. Trump politically, Mr. McConnell has consistently struck a different, more sobering tone when discussing the virus. He has publicly urged Americans to wear masks, repeatedly warned that the pandemic\xe2\x80\x99s grip will be long and said he believed a vaccine would not be widely available until next year.\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not over,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. McConnell said again on Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to have to work through it.\xe2\x80\x9dHow the White House Flouted Basic Coronavirus RulesNo masks, no social distancing, no quarantine. See how, months into the pandemic, officials ignored public health guidance as an outbreak spread.\xe2\x80\x94 Nicholas FandosThe treatment that Trump touted as a \xe2\x80\x98cure\xe2\x80\x99 for Covid-19 was developed using cells derived from fetal tissue.President Trump leaves Walter Reed Medical Center, in Bethesda, Md., on Monday after receiving treatment for Covid-19. He spent four days in the hospital after testing positive for the coronavirus.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesThe antibody cocktail for Covid-19 that President Trump touted on Wednesday afternoon was developed with cells originally derived from fetal tissue, a practice that his administration has moved to restrict.In June 2019, the Trump administration suspended federal funding for most new scientific research involving fetal tissue derived from abortions.\xe2\x80\x9cPromoting the dignity of human life from conception to natural death is one of the very top priorities of President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s administration,\xe2\x80\x9d the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement in 2019, around the time of the ban.\xe2\x80\x9cIntramural research that requires new acquisition of fetal tissue from elective abortions will not be conducted,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement added.Mr. Trump last week received Regeneron\xe2\x80\x99s cocktail of monoclonal antibodies \xe2\x80\x94 essentially, antibodies synthesized in living cells and administered to help the body fight off the infection. M.I.T. Technology Review first reported that cells originally derived from an aborted fetus were used to develop Regeneron\xe2\x80\x99s antibodies.To develop the antibodies, Regeneron relied on 293T, a cell line derived from the kidney tissue of an aborted fetus in the 1970s. At least two companies racing to produce vaccines against the coronavirus, Moderna and AstraZeneca, also are using the cell line.Remdesivir, an antiviral drug Mr. Trump received, also was tested using these cells.\xe2\x80\x9c293Ts were used in testing the antibodies\xe2\x80\x99 ability to neutralize the virus,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alexandra Bowie, a spokeswoman for Regeneron. \xe2\x80\x9cThey weren\xe2\x80\x99t used in any other way, and fetal tissue was not used in the research.\xe2\x80\x9dIn a video released Wednesday, Mr. Trump praised Regeneron\xe2\x80\x99s treatment, calling it a \xe2\x80\x9ccure\xe2\x80\x9d for Covid-19 and promising to provide it free to any patient who needed it. The company said on Wednesday that it had applied to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization.Scientists noted that the trials of the antibody cocktail are far from complete, and that Mr. Trump is taking a variety of drugs that may have explained why he said he felt better.Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s leading expert on infectious diseases, said that Mr. Trump might be right that the treatment he received has helped him in his fight with Covid-19 \xe2\x80\x94 but that his case alone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prove it.\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonably good chance that the antibody that he received, the Regeneron antibody, made a significant difference in a positive way in his course,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Fauci, who is not involved in the president\xe2\x80\x99s care, said on Thursday during an interview on MSNBC.But he pushed back against Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the treatment has now been shown to be a \xe2\x80\x9ccure\xe2\x80\x9d for the disease, which has killed more than 210,000 Americans so far.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In July, the International Society for Stem Cell Research sent a letter to the Human Fetal Tissue Research Ethics Advisory Board at the National Institutes of Health, urging the board to allow fetal tissue to be used to develop treatments for Covid-19 and for other diseases.\xe2\x80\x9cFetal tissue has unique and valuable properties that often cannot be replaced by other cell types,\xe2\x80\x9d the letter said.In August, the board rejected 13 of the 14 proposals involving fetal tissue. The approved proposal relied on tissue that had already been acquired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracking the Coronavirus \xe2\x80\xba\nUnited States\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xba\nOn Oct. 13\n14-day change\nTrend\nNew cases\n54,512\n+21%\n\nNew deaths\n826\n\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x932%\n\n\nWhere cases are\n\t\thighest\n\t\tper capita\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\tN.D.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tS.D.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMont.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWis.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tUtah\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIdaho\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNeb.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIowa\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWyo.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOkla.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArk.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTenn.\n\t\t\t\nU.S. hot spots \xe2\x80\xba\n\nCollege cases \xe2\x80\xba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 Apoorva Mandavilli and Nathalia HoltChina says it will join a global effort to distribute a vaccine.Medical workers at the SinoVac vaccine factory in Beijing, China.Credit...Ng Han Guan/Associated PressChina said on Friday that it would join a multilateral effort to manufacture and distribute a coronavirus vaccine, portraying itself as a responsible global citizen dedicated to improving public health around the world.The decision to join was \xe2\x80\x9can important step China has taken to uphold the concept of a shared community of health for all and to honor its commitment to turn Covid-19 vaccines into a global public good,\xe2\x80\x9d Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the country\xe2\x80\x99s Foreign Ministry, said in a statement.The decision highlights how Beijing is positioning itself as an influential player in international diplomacy at a time when the United States has pulled back from its role as a global leader. Such moves could potentially help China push back against accusations that its ruling Communist Party should be held responsible for its initial missteps when the virus first emerged last year.More than 160 countries have joined the international agreement known as Covax, under which the World Health Organization, GAVI the Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations aim to make sure both rich and poor countries receive new coronavirus vaccines simultaneously.The Trump administration said last month that it would not join Covax because it \xe2\x80\x9cwill not be constrained by multilateral organizations influenced by the corrupt World Health Organization and China.\xe2\x80\x9dFor weeks, China, which has four vaccine candidates in late-stage clinical trials, had been reticent about whether it would participate in the group.Ms. Hua said on Friday that the country had decided to join the vaccine agreement \xe2\x80\x9ceven when China is leading the world with several vaccines in advanced stages of R&D and with ample production capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cWe are taking this concrete step to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, especially to developing countries, and hope more capable countries will also join and support Covax,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\xe2\x80\x94 Sui-Lee WeeAdvertisementContinue reading the main story\xe2\x80\x98Silence becomes complicity\xe2\x80\x99: former C.D.C. chief calls on Redfield to stand up to Trump.President Barack Obama awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to William Foege in 2012.Credit...Kevin Lamarque/ReutersWilliam Foege, a famed epidemiologist and the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Thursday that President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence had \xe2\x80\x9ctheir knees on the neck of the public health community,\xe2\x80\x9d and called on the current C.D.C. director to stand up to them \xe2\x80\x94 even at the risk of getting fired.\xe2\x80\x9cSilence becomes complicity, and I think the one person that might have turned this around would be the director of the C.D.C.,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Foege, who served Republican and Democratic presidents, said in an interview.Dr. Foege, 84, helped lead the successful effort to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s and ran the C.D.C. under Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. He is considered a giant in the world of public health. Earlier this week, U.S.A. Today published a private letter that he wrote to the current C.D.C. director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, advising him to speak out about the administration\xe2\x80\x99s failures.In his first extensive comments since then, Dr. Foege reiterated that sentiment, saying that beyond coming clean with the public, Dr. Redfield must work to shore up his beleaguered staff and restore the institution\xe2\x80\x99s battered reputation.\xe2\x80\x9cI think he would level with C.D.C. employees and let them know what the White House has actually done \xe2\x80\x94 some of it is public \xe2\x80\x94 the fact that they were willing to put things on the C.D.C. website, that they would overrule the recommendation of C.D.C.,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Foege said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIf he said, \xe2\x80\x98I will stand behind you for as long as I\xe2\x80\x99m here,\xe2\x80\x99 and then if he gets fired he gets fired with his head held high.\xe2\x80\x9dThe White House rejected the agency\xe2\x80\x99s initial plan for reopening the country and pressured the C.D.C. to play down the risk of sending children back to school. More recently, a disputed guidance pulling back on coronavirus testing was posted on the C.D.C.\xe2\x80\x99s website over the objections of career scientists.And on Wednesday, the White House released an unusual letter written by Dr. Redfield that vouched for Mr. Pence\xe2\x80\x99s health in advance of the vice-presidential debate. Dr. Foege said he was unaware of it, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it sounds very manipulative.\xe2\x80\x9dDr. Foege suggested that Dr. Redfield was in a nearly impossible situation, working for a president who has declared all-out war on his agency and accused its scientists of being part of a \xe2\x80\x9cdeep state\xe2\x80\x9d conspiracy against him.\xe2\x80\x9cI like the man, and I am impressed that he wants to do the right thing \xe2\x80\x94 that this is not someone who is deliberately trying to do the wrong thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Foege said, adding \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\xe2\x80\x99s with this great contingent of people who can\xe2\x80\x99t stand up to a bully, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9dDr. Foege\xe2\x80\x99s letter, dated Sept. 23, opened by saying he woke up every day thinking of the \xe2\x80\x9cterrible burden\xe2\x80\x9d on Dr. Redfield. He said Thursday that he had written it out of \xe2\x80\x9cfrustration\xe2\x80\x9d that had been \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding up\xe2\x80\x9d and that he never intended for it to become public. In the interview, Dr. Foege said that he and Dr. Redfield have had an exchange about the letter, though he declined to provide specifics about their conversations.Dr. Redfield has had no comment.On Thursday, seven states reported single-day records. Montana, North Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming set records for new cases, according to a New York Times database, and South Dakota and Tennessee set records for deaths.\xe2\x80\x94 Sheryl Gay StolbergTrump releases video message to seniors, \xe2\x80\x98my favorite people in the world.\xe2\x80\x99President Trump at a roundtable about older Americans in June.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesPresident Trump released another video message on Thursday, promising to make the experimental treatment that he received for Covid-19 \xe2\x80\x9cavailable immediately\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9call free.\xe2\x80\x9dMr. Trump addressed the video, which was taped outside the White House and posted on Twitter, to older Americans, whom he called \xe2\x80\x9cmy favorite people in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d Repeating a claim he made yesterday, the president referred to a treatment, which he did not name, as a \xe2\x80\x9ccure.\xe2\x80\x9dThere is no known cure yet for the coronavirus.Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to an antibody treatment being developed by the drug company Regeneron, which he was given on an emergency basis when he was in the hospital. That treatment is still in late-stage clinical trials. Although early data has been promising, experts have said there is no way to know whether it helped Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump also repeated a suggestion that treatments could soon be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use.

But for this one thing you are vulnerable, and so am I.\xe2\x80\x9dPolling suggests that Mr. Trump is struggling to win over older Americans, a crucial voting bloc for Republicans. Although he led Hillary Clinton by five points among the cohort in 2016, several polls this week show the president trailing Joe Biden among these voters by at least 20 points.Also on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would not participate in a virtual debate, speaking on Fox Business Network minutes after the Commission on Presidential Debates announced that the next debate would be virtual because of virus concerns. Bill Stepien, Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign manager, said in a statement that the commission\xe2\x80\x99s decision was \xe2\x80\x9cpathetic\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Trump will have posted multiple negative tests prior to the debate, so there is no need for this unilateral declaration.\xe2\x80\x9dMr. Stepien\xe2\x80\x99s claim about Mr. Trump testing positive over the next week is unsubstantiated, because the virus is notoriously unpredictable.The president also repeated calls to hold China responsible for the pandemic. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are making tremendous progress with this horrible disease that was sent over by China,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cChina will pay a big price for what they did to the world and us.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 Ruth Graham and Katie ThomasGlobal roundupAs virus cases spike in rural India, the country may soon outpace the U.S.A woman and her daughter waiting as a family member was tested at a rural health center in India.Credit...Ashwini Bhatia/Associated PressDefiance of coronavirus rules in rural India is propelling the nation\xe2\x80\x99s virus caseload toward the No. 1 spot globally. Infections are rippling into every corner of this country of 1.3 billion people. The Indian news media is calling it \xe2\x80\x9cThe Rural Surge.\xe2\x80\x9dIn the Indian megacities where the pandemic first hit, vigorous public awareness campaigns have left the populace mostly on guard. But when it comes to government efforts to contain the virus, rural India is resisting.In many villages, no one is wearing masks. There is no social distancing. People are refusing to get tested and they are hiding their sick. Many believe the government is overstating the severity of the pandemic and showing no sensitivity to the economic hardship that they are suffering.That dynamic has helped India catch up with the United States in terms of total infections. U.S. cases are near 7.6 million, compared with India\xe2\x80\x99s 6.8 million, according to a New York Times database. But India outpaces new American cases by 30,000 or so each day, putting it on a path to potentially surpass the United States in the coming weeks.India Covid Map and Case CountA detailed map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with charts and tables of the number of cases and deaths.Officials say India\xe2\x80\x99s caseload is rising because nearly one million tests are being performed each day, five times the number a few months ago. They also point to India\xe2\x80\x99s relatively low death rate, about an eighth or ninth of those of the United States, Spain, Brazil and Britain.Scientists say this is mainly because India\xe2\x80\x99s population is younger and leaner, though they caution that most deaths in India, from any cause, are not investigated. And India\xe2\x80\x99s deaths are steadily ticking up, by about 1,000 a day, now totaling about 105,000.In other developments around the world:The European Union signed a deal with Gilead, the California-based pharmaceutical company, to ensure uninterrupted access to an antiviral drug being used to treat Covid-19. Veklury, also known as remdesivir, has been authorized by more than 50 countries, including the United States and in Europe, for the treatment of Covid-19 patients needing supplemental oxygen. The deal signed between Gilead and the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, would allow all members of the European Union, as well as the United Kingdom, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and several Balkan countries to buy up to 500,000 treatment courses in the next six months. An earlier contract resulted in distribution of over 33,000 treatment courses of the drug over the past two months.Poland will make face masks mandatory in public spaces starting Saturday in response to a second day of record-high case numbers, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki announced on Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cThe second wave has reached us, and we need to face it in a decisive way,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Morawiecki said. The new rule will not apply in forests, parks and beaches. Poland had implemented a lockdown early in the pandemic, but loosened restrictions over the summer, and bars and restaurants remain openIn Germany, the head of the federal institute responsible for tracking the coronavirus warned on Thursday that the country could soon see an \xe2\x80\x9cuncontrolled\xe2\x80\x9d spread of the virus. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible that we see more than 10,000 new cases per day,\xe2\x80\x9d the official, Lothar Wieler, who leads the Robert Koch Institute, said at a news conference. Germany recorded at least 4,000 new daily cases on Wednesday and has a daily average of at least 2,600 new cases over the past week, according to a New York Times database.Hong Kong\xe2\x80\x99s health secretary, Sophia Chan, said Thursday that the city was considering legal options for mandatory testing as it prepared for a new wave of coronavirus infections. She noted that research by the University of Hong Kong showed the rate of the spread was increasing once again. On Thursday, Hong Kong reported 18 new coronavirus cases, 14 of which were locally transmitted.Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s highest regional court on Thursday annulled a lockdown imposed by Spain\xe2\x80\x99s central government on the capital region. The court said that the central government did not have jurisdiction to institute restrictions that affected fundamental rights and the freedom of movement. The ruling is a major setback for the central government, and underlines both the political tensions and legal uncertainty in Spain over how to respond to the latest wave of virus cases.\xe2\x80\x94 Manuela Andreoni, Jeffrey Gettleman, Rick Gladstone, Peter S.

The city\xe2\x80\x99s mayor, Dee Margo, a Republican, has made a point of wearing a mask in public, and the city enacted a mask mandate in June.But El Paso\xe2\x80\x99s news release on Thursday cited \xe2\x80\x9cvirus fatigue\xe2\x80\x9d as a probable cause for the spike, and urged residents to remain vigilant in taking precautions, and isolating after a diagnosis.\xe2\x80\x9cWithout a vaccine or medication to cure the disease,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Ocaranza said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s up to each and every one of us to stop the spread of disease.\xe2\x80\x9dA day earlier, Bishop Mark Seitz of the Catholic Diocese of El Paso announced that he had tested positive for the virus.

That means classes conducted mostly online, dinners in dorm rooms and difficulty getting to know professors and peers. Some look forward to fleeting moments to be with others, like elevator rides. Others force themselves to take walks to be sure they see sunlight.Among them is Elle Fleenor, who hunkered down for two weeks of quarantine when she arrived on the campus of Butler University in Indianapolis. She attended orientation and lectures on Zoom, picked up food from the dining hall to eat in her room and barely interacted with anyone beyond her dorm building\xe2\x80\x99s walls.Ms. Fleenor, a first-year student from Scottsburg, Ind., knew she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have the college experience she had imagined. But she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t prepared for how the precautions her school was taking to slow the spread of the coronavirus would complicate her efforts to make friends, and how isolated that would make her feel.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been very hard, very lonesome,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Fleenor said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a freshman, being hit with all this is extremely difficult.\xe2\x80\x9dThe first semester of college is challenging even in normal times, as students get used to being away from home, their families and lifelong friends.

Fauci, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s leading expert on infectious diseases, said that President Trump might be right that the experimental treatment he received and promoted has helped him in his fight with Covid-19 \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0but that his case alone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prove it.\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonably good chance that the antibody that he received, the Regeneron antibody, made a significant difference in a positive way in his course,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Fauci, who is not involved in the president\xe2\x80\x99s care, said on Thursday during an interview on MSNBC. He pushed back against Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the treatment has now been shown to be a \xe2\x80\x9ccure\xe2\x80\x9d for the disease, which has killed more than 210,000 Americans so far. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have only one, you can\xe2\x80\x99t make the determination that that\xe2\x80\x99s a cure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to do a clinical trial involving a large number of individuals, compared either to a placebo or another intervention.\xe2\x80\x9dThe manufacturer, Regeneron, has applied to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency approval of the experimental treatment, a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies. Mr. Trumped received the Regeneron cocktail on Friday after he announced that he had tested positive for coronavirus. He has also received other treatments that are used for patients with severe cases of Covid-19, including remdesivir and dexamethasone. In a five-minute video on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that it was a \xe2\x80\x9cblessing from God\xe2\x80\x9d that he had been infected with the coronavirus and that the Regeneron cocktail had suddenly made him feel better. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt unbelievable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt good immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d The president said he would make sure that hundreds of thousands of doses would be available to Americans soon, free of charge, and he gave the impression that he would push the F.D.A. to approve the treatment. The company, however, has said that access to the treatment would be extremely limited at first, with only enough doses for 50,000 patients.The president\xe2\x80\x99s true condition is unclear. The White House doctor overseeing his care, Dr. Sean P. Conley, has admitted that he misled the public when Mr. Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In the televised interview, Dr. Fauci said it was known that a Covid-19 patient can feel good one day and go downhill quickly the next. \xe2\x80\x9cThe chances of that happening? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Fauci said of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s case. \xe2\x80\x9cAs good as he looks, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9dEarlier in the week, in a virtual event for Cornell University, his alma mater, Dr. Fauci spoke about the dangers of sending the public conflicting signals on important health issues like new treatments for Covid-19. \xe2\x80\x9cI try to, the best of my ability, in being very consistent in my messaging based on facts and scientific data,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Fauci said, according to The Cornell Daily Sun. \xe2\x80\x9cBut when there are mixed messages coming out of any institution, including the federal government, there is confusion as to what people should do.\xe2\x80\x9dHe added, \xe2\x80\x9cPersonally contradicting the president of the United States publicly is not a good thing if I want to get my job done.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Eileen Sullivan, Katie Thomas and Gina KolataThe French Open will probably finish, but not in normal fashion.The coronavirus has changed the French Open for all players, including its 12-time champion Rafael Nadal.\n Credit...Shaun Botterill/Getty ImagesThe 124th edition of the French Open was postponed four months by the pandemic and will end this weekend against the same backdrop, as infection rates rise quickly in France.The controlled environment constructed by tournament officials to keep the participants safe is holding \xe2\x80\x94 but barely.On Wednesday, the host country reported 18,746 new cases.

Restaurants have been allowed to stay open but with stricter health protocols, including social distancing, contact tracing and a closing time no later than 10 p.m.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see these things unfold again after six months,\xe2\x80\x9d the men\xe2\x80\x99s world No. 1 singles player, Novak Djokovic, said, alluding to the first lockdown, which lasted eight weeks in most of France. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go through that again.\xe2\x80\x9dThe restrictions have affected how and what the players eat.The 12-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal, for example, typically refuels after a late-night match with a meal built around a piece of fish \xe2\x80\x94 served at one of his favorite restaurants that remains open to accommodate him, or ordered from his hotel\xe2\x80\x99s round-the-clock, in-room dining service.But this year, after Mr. Nadal dispatched Mr. Sinner of Italy in a quarterfinal that ended at half-past 1 a.m., he ate protein shakes and energy bar foraged from the players\xe2\x80\x99 facilities at Roland Garros.Bon app\xc3\xa9tit and pass the tinned anchovies?If Mr. Nadal and Mr. Djokovic both win their semifinals on Friday, they will meet in the championship.
