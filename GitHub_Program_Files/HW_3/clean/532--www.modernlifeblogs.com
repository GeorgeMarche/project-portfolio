Here are 9 ways in which you can use this time to upgrade yourself and gain the required skills in todays generation to move your career forward:\xc2\xa01. Take a free digital courseWith the pandemic pushing online education to the forefront, it is now easier than ever to upgrade your skills with millions of courses available at the press of a button. Sites like Lynda, Udemy, Skillshare, Edx and Masterclass offer courses in all fields and most of these are taught by industry experts. Whats more with the pandemic keeping you home now you have enough time to complete these courses.\xc2\xa0  If you have no idea on which courses t take, read job postings for the position you are interested in or simply pick a skill you feel that youre lacking in.2. Attend webinars\xc2\xa0Webinars are a good way to learn in-depth about a topic in a short time period, usually 40-60 minutes. Even better, theyre guided by experts in the specific field or program, in real-time, so you can raise questions and experience the classroom feel. We recommend for signing up for the mailing lists from organizations like Microsoft, Skillshare and Coursera, to ensure you receive a notification when the webinar is offered.3. Earn a new certificationTake your online courses one step further and walk away with certification when you have completed your learning. By getting certified you show that you have proficiency in the skill and you passed an exam given by a certification body, which you can then leverage during your job hunting or when asking for a promotion. Based on your job profile and industry, there may be multiple certification programs and organizations to choose from.4. Explore Vocational TrainingFor some skills and job profiles, you may find certain vocational training courses run by educational institutions. These programs are run by formal schools but are shorter in duration and cost very little. In certain cases, these hands-on courses can help you upscale your portfolio and improve your chances for advancement or hiring.5. Get Formal EducationConsidering the pandemic situation formal schools are now offering many undergraduate or graduate courses via online-distance-learning at a reduced cost. You can apply and enroll for the programs online and on verification of your application, you are sent the course material and assignments online. On successfully completing the course you are awarded a regular degree. This is perfect for people who want to upgrade their skills formally while working.6. Get Technical Books/E-booksA good way to improve your technical skills is to read technical books on the subject, this will give you an understanding of the subject and help you fill the gaps in your knowledge. The great thing about books is that you can choose the book based on your level of knowledge and learn at a pace you are comfortable with. You do not have to wait for physical copies of books anymore or rush to the local library most books are now offered as e-books and can be read on any device.7. Engage In Online CommunitiesOnline communities and social network sites are great ways to connect with people and experts in your industry with similar interests and goals. Many people are happy to offer advice and share their expertise. You are still learning so dont be afraid to ask dumb questions. You will find that most experienced people are willing to help new talents. Learn the trends and lingo and keep up to date by reading blogs and browsing RSS feeds.8. Freelance Your New SkillsA great way to strengthen your new skills while you are still learning is to put them to good use and work on projects. Tap into the freelance market, people there are generally willing to work with rookies in the field. it can help you gain experience and stand out from the crowd as you upgrade your skill-set.9. Develop Knowledge of a Second LanguageMastering the third language opens many doors and helps you qualify for lots of more career options. It allows you to work in an international context and cross-check translated documents if your clients or employers require.\xc2\xa0Duolingo is a great app to get help in learning a new language. The app can help you read, write and speak the language with ease.\xc2\xa0Final thoughtsThe Corona-virus pandemic may have forced you to be locked away at home. However, you can use this time to upgrade your skills and bolster your resume.
