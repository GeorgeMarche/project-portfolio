Contaminated surfaces, such as doorknobs and light switches \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cfomites\xe2\x80\x9d, to use the scientific terminology \xe2\x80\x93 may not be such a big deal, they claimed.\n\n\n\nThe issue has resurfaced after Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told the US science magazine Nautilus that the easiest way to catch the virus was through droplets and aerosols sprayed from an infected person\xe2\x80\x99s mouth or nose.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not through surfaces,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe now know the root of the spread is not from touching surfaces and touching your eye. It\xe2\x80\x99s from being close to someone spewing virus from their nose and mouth, without in most cases knowing they are doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d\nGandhi\xe2\x80\x99s is not a lone voice. Her comments follow a prominent paper in the Lancet from Emanuel Goldman, a professor of microbiology at Rutgers University in New Jersey. He was sceptical about the relevance of scientific studies that showed the virus could survive on surfaces for days at a time.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cthe chance of transmission through inanimate surfaces is very small, and only in instances where an infected person coughs or sneezes on the surface, and someone else touches that surface soon after the cough or sneeze.\xe2\x80\x9d He defined soon as within one to two hours.\nDr Julian Tang, an honorary associate professor of respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, thinks hand washing should stay but agrees the risk from fomites has been overplayed.\nHe points to documents from the UK government\xe2\x80\x99s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) that estimate hand washing can reduce acute respiratory infections by only 16%. Meanwhile, he adds, the World Health Organization has warned about surfaces being a likely route of transmission while conceding there are no reports demonstrating infection this way.\nTang believes that a preoccupation with contaminated surfaces distracted countries from taking airborne transmission seriously and played down the necessity of wearing masks. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we\xe2\x80\x99ve always said is that the virus transmits by all routes. There might be some transmission by hand and fomites and we\xe2\x80\x99re not opposed to hand washing, but the emphasis is wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the Guardian.\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of money has been spent, and time has been spent, deep-cleaning surfaces, when the main risk is probably people talking to each other,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we had put that investment into masks earlier on, if we had put all the effort on hand washing and deep-cleaning into universal mask-wearing early on, we\xe2\x80\x99d almost certainly not have such a massive epidemic in Europe and North America.\xe2\x80\x9d\nGoldman\xe2\x80\x99s argument was founded on studies that showed traces of virus lingering on surfaces were not \xe2\x80\x9cviably\xe2\x80\x9d infectious. But William Keevil, a professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton, is not impressed. Hospital surfaces should be regularly disinfected, he points out, so it is hardly surprising that any virus lingering there is not infectious. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have been investigating disinfectants with residual activity for surface cleaning and they can work well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nWork by Keevil and others has shown that the Sars-CoV-2 virus can remain infectious on hard surfaces for days. What constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cviable\xe2\x80\x9d is still unclear, however, and will vary depending on whether the virus enters the eyes, nose or mouth through large droplets or tiny aerosols, or by touching those areas with contaminated hands. Another complicating factor is the person themselves \xe2\x80\x93 different people will have different susceptibilities to the virus. \xe2\x80\x9cEven low numbers of virus could be infectious to susceptible people,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n\nCoronavirus outbreak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\n\nInfectious diseases\n\n\n\n\nMicrobiology\n\n\n\n\nMedical research\n\n\n\n\nHealth policy\n\n\n\n\nPublic services policy\n\n\n\n\nanalysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuse this content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n\n\nUS\n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\n\n\nAsia\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\n\n\nMiddle East\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\n\n\nInequality\n\n\n\n\nGlobal development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\n\nCulture\n\n\n\n\nLifestyle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\nComplaints & corrections\n\n\n\n\nSecureDrop\n\n\n\n\nWork for us\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\n\n\nCookie policy\n\n\n\n\nTerms & conditions\n\n\n\n\nHelp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll topics\n\n\n\n\nAll writers\n\n\n\n\nDigital newspaper archive\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise with us\n\n\n\n\nGuardian Labs\n\n\n\n\nSearch jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The\xa0Guardian\n\n\nAvailable for everyone, funded by readers\n\n\n\nContribute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
