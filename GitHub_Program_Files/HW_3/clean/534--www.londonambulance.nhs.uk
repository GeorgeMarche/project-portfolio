Maisie tends to one of the bus drivers, treating his injuries and comforting him as the enormity of what has just happened starts to sink in.\nAs well as the road traffic collision in Orpington, episode 5 also features a raft of other incidents including the birth of a baby delivered at home by crew Debbie and Liam, an 86 year old woman with breathing difficulties, and a 12 year old who suffers a non-serious injury in a very delicate place thanks to a dog jumping up at him!\n\n\n\n\n 9 Oct 2020\n\nLondon Ambulance Service statement in response to the Kevin Clarke inquest\nA statement from Darren Farmer, Assistant Director of Operations at London Ambulance Service, in response to the Kevin Clarke inquest.\n\n\n\n 8 Oct 2020\n\nBBC documentary star reveals how heartbreak led him to join London Ambulance Service\nViewers of the award-winning TV show Ambulance on Wednesday night were moved by emergency ambulance crew Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s story about his dads death.\nIn the episode, aired on 7 October 33-year-old Stuart Griffiths is shown rushing to a suspected cardiac arrest alongside his crewmate paramedic Rachel.\nThree years ago, Stuart\xe2\x80\x99s dad collapsed and stopped breathing.
