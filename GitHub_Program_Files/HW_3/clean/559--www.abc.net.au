It depends on a few factors.(ABC South East SA: Sandra Morello)ShareFacebookTwitterArticle share optionsShare this onFacebookTwitterLinkedInSend this byEmailMessengerCopy linkWhatsAppPrint contentPrint with images and other mediaPrint text onlyPrintCancelSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 27,000 people in Australia have tested positive for the virus. Most of those will go through their isolation periods, many at home, before they\'re declared "recovered" by public health authorities and can return to the community.But being cleared doesn\'t always mean returning a negative test. So how can they be sure they\'re definitely over their infection?Here\'s what the experts say.LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic.Do you have to test negative to be classified as recovered? Not always \xe2\x80\x94 but this does depend on individual circumstances and where you are in Australia.In Victoria for example, when someone tests positive, the Department of Health and Human Services says most people won\'t need to be tested again once they\'ve been cleared by authorities.However if you\'ve been severely ill with persistent symptoms, hospitalised or are immunocompromised, it\'s likely you\'d be advised to get a retest.NSW Health says if confirmed cases wait out their isolation at home, they\'ll likely be cleared by a designated health practitioner if it\'s been at least 10 days since symptoms started, and at least 72 hours since you last had any fever or respiratory illness symptoms.But if you\'ve been in hospital or your symptoms haven\'t gone away after 14 days, other criteria may apply before you\'re released from isolation \xe2\x80\x94 that could include returning a negative test. Experts say the vast majority of COVID-19 cases have recovered after 10 to 14 days.(AAP: David Mariuz)South Australia has the same criteria as NSW \xe2\x80\x94 symptom-free for 72 hours and 10 days since you first got sick otherwise more criteria might apply, determined by COVID-19 GP Assessment Team doctors tasked with all isolation clearances for positive cases.Many states, including South Australia and Queensland, also have additional criteria for healthcare and aged care workers before they\'re released from isolation if they\'re a confirmed case. No matter which state or territory you\'re in, if you\'re a positive or suspected case, you need to communicate with your relevant public health authority to make sure you meet all the criteria for leaving isolation.Is it safe to return to the community without testing negative after isolation?Epidemiologist Ivo Mueller from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute says the two-week isolation period covers the vast majority of infectious periods.Professor Mueller says if people haven\'t had any symptoms for 72 hours and it\'s been seven days or more since the first onset of symptoms, they\'re most likely past their infection."From a clinical point of view, those rules that are in place are based on the available evidence of when people are infectious," he says."In a sense, testing them would basically mean that almost all people would be negative by test."Professor Mueller says the rules that are in place, based on that evidence, are sensible."I think they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty safe rules, the way it\'s being done," he says. If your isolation period is up but you\'re feeling unsure about your recovery, contact your doctor.(AAP: Danny Casey)"It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t identify from an individual person that they are non-contagious, but based on the evidence we have, all the studies that we\'ve done show that people are no longer infectious if they have no symptoms and it\xe2\x80\x99s longer than 10 days."But the director of the Menzies Health Institute\'s Infectious Diseases and Immunology Program, Nigel McMillan, says while most people will have recovered by the end of their isolation period, it would still be safer to test everyone to make sure."The gold standard is everyone needs a negative test before you\xe2\x80\x99re let out, then you\'re done," he says."While I think the likelihood of someone who has had that 14 days is very small, of still being infectious, one in 20 people will still be that way if we\xe2\x80\x99re talking 5 per cent."So why isn\'t every positive case retested to confirm they\'ve definitely recovered?There\'s a variety of reasons for this, again depending on state, territory and personal circumstance.Professor McMillan says a best-case scenario would be for health workers to travel around to where people are self-isolating and take their retests \xe2\x80\x94 but that has its challenges. "There are certainly resource implications," he says. If you still have symptoms, there\'s a good chance your isolation period will be extended.(ABC News)"The reason you don\'t necessarily want them to go out and get tested, even though they\xe2\x80\x99re going to wear a mask and the like, is that you\xe2\x80\x99re essentially having them out in public in places where a whole lot of other people are going to get tested anyway. It may be more practical, but it\'s not as ideal.\xc2\xa0"This is where the rubber hits the road in terms of resources, practicality and pragmatism. But ideally, (health workers) would go to someone\'s house and do it."Professor Mueller also says physically collecting retests would be more of an issue than Australia\'s current testing capacity, which is pretty strong.But ultimately, he says the current conditions to be released from isolation exist because most people will have recovered within that period."The vast, vast majority of people tested would be negative by the time they\xe2\x80\x99re released from self-isolation, based on these definitions," he says."There could be some weird outliers, but these weird outliers that have been described don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean that somebody who is still PCR positive after that would actually be infectious. "There may just be residual genetic material of the virus present, not live virus. The PCR test will not necessarily tell you that."Stay up-to-date on the coronavirus outbreakDownload the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest on how the pandemic is impacting the worldWhat if you\'re still sick after 14 days?Sorry, you\'re not going anywhere. In most jurisdictions rules are in place that you will only be released from self-isolation if it\'s been 72 hours since you were last symptomatic, even if it\'s been more than two weeks, so people who do experience longer infections aren\'t released while still contagious."What we do know is in people who keep coughing, there can be some virus in the mucus they cough up," Professor Mueller says."That\xe2\x80\x99s why you can\xe2\x80\x99t have any respiratory symptoms in the three days before (leaving isolation)." You must self-isolate while awaiting any COVID-19 test results, even if you feel fine.(ABC News)Alternatively, some people can return a positive test based on residual virus when they have no symptoms and aren\'t infectious."The main problem with these cases is that it\'s not clear whether the virus you detect are actually alive and therefore transmittable, or whether you\xe2\x80\x99re just detecting genetic material of the virus," Professor Mueller says."It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that you can have people that could have some genetic material, some dead virus left that could be detected when they\'re tested.\xc2\xa0"But the evidence really indicates that people are no longer infectious 10 days after the onset of symptoms, unless they\xe2\x80\x99re having clear fever or respiratory symptoms."Read more about coronavirus:Andrew tested positive for COVID-19 six months apart, what does this mean for immunity and a vaccine?Here\'s what the numbers tell us about when Melbourne\'s lockdown can endCan you go and get another test after your isolation period anyway?Yes, there\'s nothing stopping you from requesting another test even if you\'ve been cleared to leave isolation.Professor McMillan says people who have finished their isolation could seek another test for their own peace of mind. "There\xe2\x80\x99s clearly a payoff between those potentially 5 per cent who have got a very slow infection or are still infectious versus the 95 per cent of people who will be no longer infectious after that," he says."I still think the gold standard is testing, and then everyone who\'s have it and was positive, should test negative."Don\'t forget, you need to stay home while you\'re awaiting any test results.
