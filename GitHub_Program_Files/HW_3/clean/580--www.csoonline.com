What can we expect the impact to be on organizations as a result of delayed or cancelled security projects?For answers, we turned to members of the IDG Influencer Network, a community of industry analysts, IT professionals, and journalists. While their viewpoints were varied, as would be expected, Helen Yu (@YuHelenYu), a C-Level Tech Executive, spoke for many when she said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe COVID-19 pandemic has become a catalyst for cyberattacks.\xe2\x80\x9dWill Kelly (@willkelly), a Senior Technical Writer, was similarly blunt: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to see a new era of corporate data breaches,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Frank Cutitta (@fcutitta), CEO and Founder of HealthTech Decisions Lab, worries that the consequences could be grave, especially given that businesses have become much more reliant on rapidly deployed technology to fill the gap in face-to-face interactions.\xe2\x80\x9cHistory tells us that developing a culture of security at the employee level is not for the faint of heart,\xe2\x80\x9c he added. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, we can send phishing tests to employees to see if they bite, but with more sophisticated hacks and ransomware, the lack of sophisticated security platforms will take its toll.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cInformation security abhors a vacuum. Attackers and your firm\xe2\x80\x99s adversaries will capitalize on those delays to their advantage,\xe2\x80\x9d warned Ben Rothke (@benrothke), Senior Information Security Specialist at Tapad. \xe2\x80\x9cAttackers were ready with their stimulus scams well before the stimulus checks were even mailed. Most delays in information security deployments have a corresponding risk that must be considered.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cPlaying defense with an uptick in phishing attacks and malware is a horrible position to be in, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the likelihood for not just small-cap companies but also mid-caps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sarah Ramsingh (@SarahRamsingh), a Machine Learning and Quantum Mechanics Expert. \xe2\x80\x9cThe impact is having your organization in a more vulnerable position.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cSecurity moves very fast, obviously, and it\xe2\x80\x99s already hard to keep up with the attackers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tricia Howard (@TriciaKicksSaaS), Marketing Manager at HolistiCyber. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is why burnout is so rampant in our industry. Security professionals are having to be on 24/7 and it\xe2\x80\x99s not sustainable.\xe2\x80\x9dAn \xe2\x80\x98acceptable trade-off\xe2\x80\x99 if bankruptcy is the only other optionKayne McGladrey (@kaynemcgladrey), Cybersecurity Strategist at Ascent Solutions, said delaying or cancelling security projects is \xe2\x80\x9can acceptable trade-off\xe2\x80\x9d only if bankruptcy is the alternative.\xe2\x80\x9cDue to the pandemic, this is the choice that some organizations face today,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cOther organizations should first prioritize their security projects to mitigate those risks with the highest potential impact to the business. Organizations should then have a difficult conversation about residual risks with their cyber insurance providers, and plan to implement monitoring of those risks not transferred to insurance or mitigated through implementation of technical controls.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x98Security needs to be front and center\xe2\x80\x99Not all of the Influencers painted such a bleak picture.\xe2\x80\x9cNow\xe2\x80\x99s the time to double down on information security,\xe2\x80\x9d advised George Gerchow (@georgegerchow), Chief Security Officer at Sumo Logic. \xe2\x80\x9cSince the pandemic started, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a rise in ransomware, endpoint attacks, phishing, and nation-state indicators of compromise. In times of high uncertainty and anxiety, bad actors thrive. Lock down those endpoints and start building a Zero Trust model.\xe2\x80\x9dFormer IT Director Cedric Wells (@cedricfwells) agreed.\xe2\x80\x9cUnderstandably, many organizations are closely watching their cash flow and preparing for the worst with what has now been declared as a recession,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI agree that there needs to be more scrutiny and prioritization of security projects. However, now more than ever, with a more distributed workforce, security needs to be front and center. Delaying or canceling security projects at a minimum will put organizations at a greater risk.\xe2\x80\x9dScott Schober (@ScottBVS), President and CEO of Berkeley Varitronics Systems Inc., was also optimistic, pointing out that when companies put off expenditures in areas such as security, they tend to come back and spend at an accelerated rate when economic conditions improve.\xe2\x80\x9cOnce the pandemic fears calm, CEOs, CIOs and CISOs will be preparing for a new wave of security spending,\xe2\x80\x9d he predicted.Brian Thomas (@DivergentCIO), Chief Technology Officer for Coruzant Technologies, expressed a similar view.\xe2\x80\x9cWhile some of these projects may have been delayed, by and large technology leaders still have critical security projects at the top of their priority list,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is too much at stake today with the plethora of malware and ransomware attacks, no matter the company size or budget.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cWorking with customers every day, and the partners who serve them in the Microsoft ecosystem, I am seeing less of a pullback and more differentiation in how our customers worldwide are approaching projects in the security space,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wayne Anderson (@DigitalSecArch), Security and Compliance Architect with Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s M365 Center of Excellence. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a matter of \xe2\x80\x98Are companies spending more or not?\xe2\x80\x99 but rather it\xe2\x80\x99s a question of \xe2\x80\x98Which projects are getting investment right now?\xe2\x80\x99 While there are about a fifth of companies that are overall decreasing cybersecurity budget, broadly a majority are reorienting around the remote work atmosphere and the data streams that are critical to next-generation business.\xe2\x80\x9dRatan Jyoti (@reach2ratan), Chief Information Security Officer of Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Limited, was also focused on the future.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s high time for organizations to reorient their security budget in the right area,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere can be a huge spike in security budgets in 2021 as remote working has introduced a new array of risks that must be managed. I also see a huge hike in cloud and automation in 2021.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cThere may be projects that will have to be deferred around increasing efficiency or improving the user experience, which may set the organization back compared to their peers, but these activities can't be prioritized over preventing breaches and maintaining compliance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Larry Larmeu (@LarryLarmeu), an Enterprise Technology Leader.Caroline Wong (@CarolineWMWong), CIO of Cobalt, said that if key security projects were delayed or cancelled to make room for critical projects that would enable a distributed workforce to work more securely (for example, VPN implementation or training on how to setup a secure home WiFi network), \xe2\x80\x9cthen it could be a positive change, resulting in a more secure setup given the new work environment.\xe2\x80\x9dWithin the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tanium helped the world\xe2\x80\x99s most demanding organizations recover their operations and regain control and visibility.
