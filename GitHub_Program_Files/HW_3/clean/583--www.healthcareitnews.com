It\xe2\x80\x99s a national scale clinical risk incident. The delayed communication of data has hampered our understanding of the spread of the virus and the ability to mitigate it."\n"The fact that this stems from the misuse of commonly deployed software necessitates investigation by a Clinical Safety Officer and a review of whether NHS agencies are adequately resourced in terms of people, processes and technology to manage the mounting data needed for test and trace to be effective.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTopics:\xa0Government & Policy, Population Health\nMore regional news\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Zesty Patient Portal\xa0\n\nCerner and Zesty collaborate on new NHS patient engagement solution By Sara MageitOctober 14, 2020\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Healthcare Communications\n\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s College Hospital to advance its \'digital by default\' patient engagement strategy By Sara MageitOctober 13, 2020\n\n\n\nBetter EHR training in the working environment?October 12, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to get more stories like this\n          one?
