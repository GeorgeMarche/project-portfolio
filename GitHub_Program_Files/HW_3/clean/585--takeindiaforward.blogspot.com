Here i just like the highlight the case of Bara Hindu Rao Hospital. Its the biggest Municipal Hospital in North Delhi & has been at forefront of fight against Covid-19 pandemic along with other Government Hospitals in Delhi. But now the Hospital has stopped treatment of Covid-19 patients as Doctors, Nurses & other hospital staff have gone on Strike. Reason - Non payment of salary since last 4 months. But this is nothing new. The protest against delay & non payment of salaries of Doctors have been going on since many months.    (Photo - IANS)The non payment of salaries of doctors is the fault of Central Government. Local & State governments have lost most of their revenue in this pandemic induced economic depression.

The death of SC justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has exasperated instability in US supreme court (already controlled by GOP inclined judges) and raised the stakes of 2020 elections. The simple fact of 2020 elections is the urgent need to kick madman Trump out of White house. RBGs death has complicated US political situation on two fronts. Firstly, its obvious that Trump regime is now deeply unpopular & hated and likely staring at election defeat. Hence, Trump & his plutocratic backers want to take over Supreme Court to maintain a degree of power after Trump is gone. Secondly, fight over SC judge nomination is also an opportunity for failing Trump to attack & destabilize Biden campaign.In wake of RBG's death, Democrats should adopt a simple strategy - Division of Labor. One faction - Parliamentary Democrats - should prepare for tooth & nail political fight to stop Trump installing a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBudget crisis of States in Covid-19 economic slowdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Apps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 01, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI wrote an article on what Central Govt needs to do on Budget making in this pandemic emergency. But our Politicians, Ministers, Policy makers & Policy advisers have very different view of the economic situation. For Modi Govt, the economic shock which India is facing is just a discrepancy of numbers. The rise in fiscal deficits, fall in tax collections, downgrade of India's sovereign credit ratings, amount of GST compensation to states etc - Modi Govt only think about managing these numbers without thinking about the actual underlying economic catastrophe going on in India. There is rapidly rising unemployment, collapse of demand, collapse in private & Govt capital investment, failure of businesses, personal bankruptcy of people & losses in MSME sector, failure of healthcare system as its overburdened & ultimately rising poverty & falling standards of living in middle class & lower class segments of population.

But establishing a dictatorship is not easy as it requires some prerequisites and control over certain critical areas of nation. Modi & Shah regime has these five centers of power which help them establish their dictatorial rule over the country.Military & Paramilitary Armed forces - Army is used as a Political instrument to create a Nationalistic image  You can't impose a dictatorship without controlling the military. Military is the most critical part of Modi's dictatorship. Control over military is the main MUSCLES of dictators & also give De Facto legitimacy & authority to ruling dictators. By controlling the military, other aspects of dictatorship can be enforced & implemented. The military which was supposed to be independent & apolitical is now a tool & instrument in hands of Modi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia's LAC crisis and broader National Security picture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Apps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 24, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLadakh (Photo-PTI)\nChina is trying to change the status Quo of India-China Border and aggressively used its Army to capture certain strategic locations on the India-China Border creating a new crisis in India.\nTo give a quick background. India was a colony of Britain for more than 200 years. When Britain departed India in 1947, various issues regarding India's Territorial Borders emerged. This was exasperated by creation of new State of Pakistan, dispute of Kashmir region and also dispute in Ladakh region on Chinese border. India has fought several wars (1948, 1965, 1971, 1999) with Pakistan over Kashmir region and also a war (1962) with China over Territorial dispute. But since a long time, there is peace on Border situation with China & Pakistan apart from few odd incidents. Last major military battle between India & Pakistan was in 1999.\nThe borders of India & Pakistan are established as LOC. Whereas both sides claim each others territory, neither side has tried to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowered by Blogger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanjeev\n\n\n\n\nVisit profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 20201\n\n\nSeptember 20202\n\n\nAugust 20201\n\n\nJune 20202\n\n\nMay 20202\n\n\nApril 20204\n\n\nMarch 20208\n\n\nFebruary 20205\n\n\nJanuary 20201\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
