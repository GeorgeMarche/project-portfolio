We partner with small and local charities with an annual income of \xc2\xa325k - \xc2\xa31million helping people overcome complex social issues such as mental health, homelessness and domestic abuse.\nThrough core cost funding,\xc2\xa0developmental support\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0influencing\xc2\xa0policy and practice, we help those charities make life-changing impact.\nApplications for the COVID Recovery Fund are now closed.

Last updated 11 September 2020 | Paul Streets: Our thinking and approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe work in partnership with the charities we fund and others who share our vision. We listen, understand and respond to charities, through funding and providing developmental support we help them grow stronger and more sustainable. We influence policy and practice to help charities thrive in the future and to address the root causes and consequences of complex social issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddiction and Dependency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsylum Seekers and Refugees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCare Leavers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomestic Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeless and Vulnerably Housed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffending, Prison or Community Service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRacial Equity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSexual Abuse and Exploitation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrafficking and Modern Slavery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung Parents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than just funders\nSmall charities\xe2\x80\x99 size and understanding of the people and local communities means they\xe2\x80\x99re able to make life-changing impact where others can\xe2\x80\x99t. But they are under-funded, under pressure and too often ignored. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re more than just a funder \xe2\x80\x94 we work in partnership with the charities we fund and others who share our vision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources for Charities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur work is based on trust and relationships, so it takes months or even years. Other funders often want to see transformation within 12 months, but life isn\xe2\x80\x99t like that. When we meet our service users they\xe2\x80\x99re in crisis or survival mode. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready to talk about change immediately. It takes years to deal with a lifetime of abuse, trauma and addiction and rebuild lives. We\xe2\x80\x99re very fortunate that Lloyds Bank Foundation understand that and is willing to fund it all.\nRosie Hart, Director, Kairos Women Working Together\n\n\n\n\n\nLife-changing impact \nWe support over 700 small and local charities across England and Wales.

We\xe2\x80\x99re all different but share a similar positive attitude. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done lots of courses here and spend a lot of time gardening.
