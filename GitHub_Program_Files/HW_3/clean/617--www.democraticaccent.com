In the research,\xc2\xa0Anita Iyer\xc2\xa0and her team measured antibody responses in the blood of 343 patients with COVID-19 for up to 122 days after symptom onset, and compared these responses to those of 1,548 control individuals sampled before the pandemic. The scientists focused only on antibodies specific to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein which it uses to enter host cells.\nThey estimated sensitivities of the antibody types IgG, IgA, and IgM at 95 per cent, 90 per cent and 81 per cent, respectively, for detecting infected individuals between 15 to 28 weeks after symptom onset. Among these antibodies, the study noted that spike protein-specific IgM and IgA were short-lived, dropping beneath detection levels at around 49 and 71 days, respectively, after the appearance of symptoms. However, it noted that the spike protein-targeted IgG responses decayed slowly over a period of 90 days, with only three individuals losing them within this timeframe. According to the researchers, the levels of spike protein-specific IgG strongly correlated with levels of neutralising antibodies in the patients. They also did not observe cross-reactivity of any SARS-CoV-2-targeting antibodies with other common cold coronaviruses.\nAnother study published in the journal Science also found that while IgA and IgM antibodies targeting the spike proteins receptor binding domain rapidly decayed, the IgG type remained relatively stable for up to 105 days after symptom onset in 402 patients with COVID-19. In this study, researchers including Baweleta Isho from the University of Toronto in Canada, detected spike protein-specific antibodies in the saliva, as well as the blood, of these patients.\nThey charted the patients antibody responses from three to 115 days after symptom onset, and compared their profiles with 339 pre-pandemic controls. The scientists found that patients with COVID-19 showed peak IgG levels at 16 to 30 days after the appearance of symptoms. According to the researchers, the levels of all spike protein-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies in the blood positively correlated with levels observed in matched saliva samples. Given that the virus can also be measured in saliva by PCR, using saliva as a biofluid for both virus and antibody measurements may have some diagnostic value, they wrote in the study.\nShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\n\nRelated\n \nTags: Anita Iyer, Baweleta Isho, Harvard Medical School, Indian, Indian-origin Scientists, saliva of patients, science, viral infection \n\nContinue Reading\nPrevious Family of woman mistakenly declared dead sues Michigan cityNext UN World Food Programme wins Nobel Peace Prize\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\nSOCIAL WELFARE PARTNERTRENDING NEWS \n\xe2\x80\x98Vigilant India, Prosperous India\xe2\x80\x99 theme for this year\xe2\x80\x99s vigilance awareness week: CVC \n\nEDMC issues helpline numbers for streetlight complaints redressal \n\nUP govt official found dead \n\nMan held for killing Indian monitor lizard \n\nMan stabbed to death in Rajasthan's Kota \nFIND US ON FACEBOOK \n\nFIND US ON FACEBOOK\n\nSUBSCRIBE US\n\nEnter your email address to subscribe to Democratic Accent and receive exclusive notifications of new posts on your email address at just INR 150 per month. \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJoin 2,122 other subscribers\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail Address                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t                        Subscribe                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                            You may have missed                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n                                 INDIA\n                             \n\n \n                                 STATES\n                             \n \n\n\n\n\n                                Karnataka reports 9,265 cases and 75 deaths                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                    11 mins ago            \n\n\n                Team Democratic Accent            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n                                 INDIA\n                             \n\n \n                                 STATES\n                             \n \n\n\n\n\n                                Monsoon fury throws life out of gear in Hyderabad                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                    14 mins ago            \n\n\n                Team Democratic Accent            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n                                 INDIA\n                             \n \n\n\n\n\n                                Central Railway to run 28 more services of local trains                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                    18 mins ago            \n\n\n                Team Democratic Accent            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n                                 INDIA\n                             \n\n \n                                 STATES\n                             \n \n\n\n\n\n                                Rains lash Pune city, heavy rains forecast in some parts                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                    26 mins ago            \n\n\n                Team Democratic Accent            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n                                 NORTH & SOUTH AMERICA\n                             \n\n \n                                 WORLD\n                             \n \n\n\n\n\n                                Wisconsin judge blocks governors order limiting capacity                            \n\n\n\n\n\n                    3 hours ago            \n\n\n                Team Democratic Accent            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                Copyright \xc2\xa9 Democratic Accent                                                                                     | \nCoverNews by AF themes.                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
