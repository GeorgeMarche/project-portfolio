With the advice of Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson later the third President of the United States and consent of the Senate, President Washington commissioned Joy to that office on November 21, 1792.\nJoy, however, reached Kolkata only in April 1794. He was never recognized as Consul by the British East India Company but was permitted to reside here as a Commercial Agent subject to the Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction of this Country.\nDespite this rather inauspicious beginning, Benjamin Joys arrival was the beginning of a long official American relationship with Kolkata  and, indeed, with all of India.\n NextConsul General Patti Hoffman\n\n\n\nTranslation\xd8\xa7\xd8\xb1\xd8\xaf\xd9\x88\xe0\xa4\xb9\xe0\xa4\xbf\xe0\xa4\xa8\xe0\xa5\x8d\xe0\xa4\xa6\xe0\xa5\x80Contact Us38A, J.L.Nehru Road,\nKolkata - 700 071,\nWest Bengal, India.\nTel:  91-33-3984-6300\nFax: 91-33-2288-1616/0356\nHoliday Calendar2016 Mission wide Holidays2016 Kolkata Holidays (PDF 178KB)TwitterFacebookYouTubeDownload Adobe Reader \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Embassy in IndiaVisas\nU.S. Citizen Services\nOur Relationship\nBusiness\nEducation & Culture\nEmbassy & Consulates\nNews & Events\nPrivacy\nSitemap\n \nU.S. Embassy  U.S. Embassy New Delhi\nShantipath, Chanakyapuri\nNew Delhi - 110021\nPhone: 011-91-11-2419-8000\nFax: 011-91-11-2419-0017\nTwitterFacebookYouTubeFlickr\n U.S. Consulates Consulate General Chennai\nConsulate General Hyderabad\nConsulate General Kolkata\nConsulate General Mumbai\nVirtual Consulate Bengaluru\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Disclaimer This is the official website of the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in India.
