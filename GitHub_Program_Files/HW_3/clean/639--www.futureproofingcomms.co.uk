Key themes include the role of comms in achieving organisational outcomes; how organisations can secure and maintain trust; planning and data; digital-first strategies; how to address barriers to technological innovation; and the role of practitioners in managing major change.And in November 2018, in a move away from the norm, a special edition of #FuturePRoof  was published, called Once upon a time in PR: Twenty-one public relations pioneers shaping our industry. Designed as a short storybook, this told the story of 21 larger than life characters who are doing things differently and helping the PR industry to grow and thrive today.\xa0Those featured include the industry\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Severus Snape\xe2\x80\x99, PRCA chief Francis Ingham, \xe2\x80\x98agency alchemist\xe2\x80\x99 Stephen Waddington and The PR Network\xe2\x80\x99s Nicky Regazzoni and George Blizzard, likened to the royal siblings in Frozen as sisters doing it for themselves.Each of the industry protagonists is represented through an ink portrait and short story.  You can see these displayed in a gallery at the PRCA thanks to director general Francis Ingham. Hot off the pressNow edition four has launched in September 2020 to celebrate BME talent. Topics range from audience targeting, social media, partnership working, reputation, pitching to radio and community building through to public affairs, internal comms, leadership, coaching and the psychology of decision-making. A piece on media diversity provides an important view on what happens when journalists don\xe2\x80\x99t represent the communities they serve, while two further chapters deliver excellent insight into how to hire and nurture diverse talent.The book concludes with a chapter on COVID-19, purpose and PR, looking at how 2020 has ushered in a new era for strategic public relations.Teeming with smart thinking and advice from in house and agency practitioners, academics, journalists and recruiters, this particular #FuturePRoof book also shines a light on the systemic issues underpinning racism in the workplace and provides guidance for those keen to stamp this out.The #FutureProof series of books are available to purchase here. They feature on university reading lists across the UK and  are eligible for CIPR CPD points. The story doesn\'t stop thereOf course, #FuturePRoof is not just about the books but about constant industry change and what the PR community needs to survive and thrive. Two white papers have been co-written with Stephen Waddington, one characterising the public relations agency business, the other exploring the mental wellbeing of the profession. Guidance on disinformation and fake news and a report on influencer marketing governance for public relations have also been published.#FuturePRoof training workshops have been delivered to regional comms teams of organisations including Disney, SAP, Weber Shandwick and Macmillan Cancer Support.\xa0A #FuturePRoof podcast is available on iTunes and Spotify and the #FuturePRoof blog features regular guest contributions (please contact sarah@futureproofingcomms.co.uk if you have a topic you\'d like to pitch).
