It is unknown if anyone else on his campaign team have tested positive. \nWilson says he is experiencing mild symptoms and has begun a 10-day quarantine. He also said he is suspending all in-person campaigning for the next 10 days.\nI recently tested positive for COVID-19. Like so many of my fellow Americans, I am not immune from COVID-19. This is a disease that does not discriminate, Wilson said in a press statement.\nWilson is running as an independent against US. Sen. Dick Durbin. Within the last few months, Wilson has led an effort to donate millions of masks and other PPE in Chicago.\nThis is a developing story.
