Located on Watergate Street, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the rapid expansion of Chester\xe2\x80\x99s speciality coffee scene that has seen numbers swell in the last few years. Like many of the city\xe2\x80\x99s speciality coffee shops, it has a basement-like feel, stretching a long way back under the famous Rows and it looks, and feels, remarkably like it did on my last visit in 2019.\nHowever, there have been changes. As well the (admittedly minor) physical ones, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a clear sign outside on the pavement reminding you that you must wear a mask. Meanwhile, there\xe2\x80\x99s a QR code on the counter that you can scan, checking you in on the NHS COVID-19 app. Not all the changes are COVID-19 related though. Chalk Coffee used to use Origin for its house espresso, but it\xe2\x80\x99s recently changed to Colonna Coffee, although Origin is still on decaf, while a regularly-changing guest roaster provides the second espresso option and filter. Meanwhile, if you\xe2\x80\x99re hungry, the usual cast of premade sandwiches and cakes are still available.\nYou can see what else I found after the gallery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n\nPhoto Carousel by WOWSlider.com v4.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the outside, on the north side of Chester\xe2\x80\x99s Watergate Street, Chalk Coffee looks much as it ever did, although there are now only two tables in front of the windows, one on either side of the door. There\xe2\x80\x99s also the A-board, with the aforementioned message about masks.\nInside, things are also remarkably similar, with the layout, d\xc3\xa9cor and seating much as it was before, only with more plants. There are a few changes, however. For example, the bicycle that used to hang on the wall to left, between the windows and the counter, has gone, replaced by a large plant which, despite the low light levels, seems to be thriving. There is also one change to the seating. At the back, beyond the counter, the two tall, four-person tables that used to line the high, padded sofa bench have gone, although the sofa itself remains. This opens up the rear part of Chalk Coffee quite magnificently.\nThe main change, however, is with the coffee, where Colonna Coffee has replaced Origin as the house espresso, with a naturally-processed Brazilian in the hopper during my visit. Origin remains on decaf while a guest roaster provides a second espresso option and the batch brew filter. And who was the guest roaster during my visit? None other than Colonna, although the staff assure me that this was a one-off!\nI was tempted by the guest espresso, the Don Sabino, a naturally-processed coffee from Costa Rica, part of Colonna\xe2\x80\x99s Discovery range. What can I say? It was gorgeous, with a rich, syrupy sweetness. It was very fruity on the first couple of sips, after which a little more acidity came through. I was so impressed that I bought a bag to bring home with me, which I\xe2\x80\x99ve been running through my Sage Barista Express. While I haven\xe2\x80\x99t quite hit the same heights with it as the baristas at Chalk managed, its still one of the best home espressos I\xe2\x80\x99ve had this year, an instant contender for this year\xe2\x80\x99s Best Espresso Award!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 24 WATERGATE STREET \xe2\x80\xa2 CHESTER \xe2\x80\xa2 CH1 2LA\n\n\nwww.chalkcoffee.co.uk \n+44 (0) 1244 343345\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday\n09:00 \xe2\x80\x93 17:00\n\nRoaster\nColonna Coffee + Guests (espresso + batch brew)\n\n\nTuesday\n09:00 \xe2\x80\x93 17:00\n\nSeating\nTables, Window Bars; Tables (outside)\n\n\nWednesday\n09:00 \xe2\x80\x93 17:00\n\nFood\nSandwiches, Cake\n\n\nThursday\n09:00 \xe2\x80\x93 17:00\n\nService\nOrder at Counter\n\n\nFriday\n09:00 \xe2\x80\x93 17:00\n\nPayment\nCards Only (COVID-19)\n\n\nSaturday\n09:00 \xe2\x80\x93 17:00\n\nWifi\nFree (with login)\n\n\nSunday\n09:00 \xe2\x80\x93 17:00\n\nPower\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\nChain\nNo\n\nVisits\nOriginal: 14th May 2019\nUpdate: 2nd October 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you liked this Coffee Spot, then check out the rest of Chesters speciality coffee scene with the Coffee Spot Guide to Chester.\n\nIf you liked this post, please let me know by clicking the Like button.
