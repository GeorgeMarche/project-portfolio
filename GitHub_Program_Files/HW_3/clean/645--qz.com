Almost seven months later, office reopenings are only partial, and guidelines remain strict. While working from home in India can have big advantages, it\xe2\x80\x99s also taking a toll on mental health. A third of workers in India have been feeling more burnt out over the past six months, according to a recent survey from Microsoft. Some 40% say they are stressed by the lack of separation between work and personal life, while 35% said they feel disconnected from their colleagues. The ideal WFH setup\xe2\x80\x94spatially, mentally, emotionally\xe2\x80\x94is a topic of much discussion at Quartz, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for more resources check out our guides to borderless teams, the home office, and managing remote employees (also our series on cultivating resilience). But one of the best tools we\xe2\x80\x99ve found, other than a commitment to wearing pants during work hours, is talking to and commiserating with each other.

But for many cities around the world, an even more important project will be improving access to affordable housing. As people are forced to move away from communities that flooding, wildfires, and other climate impacts have made unlivable, they will need somewhere to go. A recent study projected that there may be 13 million such climate migrants in the US alone by 2100.The trouble is, the housing market in cities that could be \xe2\x80\x9cclimate havens\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94those that are relatively isolated from environmental impacts and have room to grow\xe2\x80\x94is trending in the opposite direction. Of 10 US cities researchers identified as likely climate havens, all but one have seen the availability of affordable housing decrease in recent years, most faster than the national average:Read more about the effort to prepare cities for climate migrants\xe2\x80\x94and take a stab at designing your own climate haven\xe2\x80\x94in our Green Haven package, part of our Rethinking Cities obsession.Support Quartz journalism with our new referral program.
