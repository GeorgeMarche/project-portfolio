On the nonfiction section shelf next to a book about NSA whistleblower Eric Snowden by award-winning journalist Luke Harding rest copies of a book called 8 Women: Pure Platinum People, by K.M. Harris, a Maori woman author from New\xa0Zealand.\nOff the Pass Press was the publisher of Harris\xe2\x80\x99s debut first person narrative and gonzo-styled work where she gave observations and a non-judgmental voice to\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8aamong other interesting people\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8avarious women working in Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s sex industry.\nI first approached Harris last year around the time me and a few other Montana Native American writers had just put out a book called Off the Path: An Anthology of 21st Century Montana American Indian Writers Vol. 1. Although that book has been highly praised\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8aparticularly for the unapologetically blunt, highly original, and dark storytelling\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8aits uniqueness also lies in the fact that, as far as I know, there has never been an anthology of all-original, straight fiction works written solely by American\xa0Indians.\nAs far as I know, there has never been an anthology of all-original, straight fiction works written solely by American\xa0Indians.\nCertainly, Native-based anthologies have been made, but those oft include a lot of poetry or samples of previously published works from the famous Native American Renaissance writers of the late 60s\xe2\x80\x9380s. Since Off the Path Vol. I writers were in their twenties and thirties, our experiences not only differed generation-wise, but so did the nuances of us being various Northern Plains Montanan tribes (barring the late Blackfeet writer James Welch who is mentioned in the prologue as an inspiration).\nFor Volume II, I wanted indigenous writers included from across the U.S. and wherever else younger \xe2\x80\x9c21st century\xe2\x80\x9d indigenous writers might be. Certainly, I wanted to see if any up and coming Maori writers were willing to contribute, as I\xe2\x80\x99d come across references to their culture via a Kiwi/New Zealand friend who worked at the Native American Studies Department at the University of Montana. And a few years earlier I\xe2\x80\x99d interviewed a Stanford graduate from my own Northern Cheyenne tribe who had traveled back and forth from New Zealand, making her secondary homeland amongst the Maori\xa0people.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re just like Natives here in that they\xe2\x80\x99re very family-oriented,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me. \xe2\x80\x9cTribalism is very much alive and well over there, and they have language programs to keep their culture thriving and\xa0alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThrough the powerful God-like tool that is the internet I came across the passionately driven Harris. She was very excitable and eager to communicate with Native Americans from \xe2\x80\x9cthe States,\xe2\x80\x9d especially after reading Volume I and counting herself a major fan of our work\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8aparticularly of Northern Cheyenne and Dartmouth graduate Cinnamon Spear, a writer whose powerful work has the ability to cause just about anyone to wipe away\xa0tears.\nAlthough it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a guarantee she\xe2\x80\x99d be published in Off the Path II, An Anthology of American Indian and Indigenous Writers, I gave Harris and other possible contributors deadlines and said you know the sort of \xe2\x80\x9cbeautifully bleak\xe2\x80\x9d work I prefer so give me your best, and that she did in a fascinating short story called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Recruit.\xe2\x80\x9d It details, among other surprising subplots, the death of a young woman who joined the proud New Zealand Army that incorporates Maori fighting instincts and traditions. A young narrator speaks of her deceased\xa0sister:\nSurrendering, my heart surrenders to the aching stabs inside my chest. The punctures cause my rain to pour, charging the static storm in my head and I am a mess in this weather of \xe2\x80\x98whether.\xe2\x80\x99 Whether I cry or pray, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to bring her back and whether I gamble with the Devil to resurrect her soul, it\xe2\x80\x99s still not going to bring her\xa0back.\nBeautifully bleak,\xa0indeed.\nOff the Path Vol. I began with a Sherman Alexie\xe2\x80\x99s preface quote, \xe2\x80\x9cI write in blood because I remember what it felt like to bleed,\xe2\x80\x9d foreshadowing an array of oft tragic stories that transported readers into the lives of American Indian people amidst their modern day struggles and conflicts away from the tourist hot spots, pow wow celebrations, and historical caricatures that most often represent us to a mainstream western world that usually barely recognizes us through eyes of a whitewashed history that views our own narrative as inconvenient.\nFor example, after the Indian Wars effectively ended in the late 19th century, Native children who dared speak the languages first heard across this land were severely reprimanded and beaten in the boarding schools they were forced to attend far away from their homelands.\nStorytelling reignited the fire that colonization tried to extinguish.\n\xe2\x80\x9cKill the Indian, save the man,\xe2\x80\x9d a phrase coined by Richard Henry Pratt of the infamous Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania, became a de facto motto for all boarding schools as tribal children were taught to be ashamed of who they were and where they came from. \xe2\x80\x9cLet all that is Indian within you die!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rev. J.A. Lippincott at a Carlisle commencement address. Students were told they could never become \xe2\x80\x9ctruly American\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 until the Indian within you is\xa0dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut through it all and under the scarred ashes of their collective histories, a fierce, resistant, and proud spirit remained smoldering. Elders told stories that would carry on tribal traditions and history. In fact, storytelling is what kept Natives proud even as Western Civilization attempted to drill into them the notion that they were inferior. Storytelling reignited the fire that colonization tried to extinguish.\nThen, as more Natives learned to write, we were able to relate on a personal level with other indigenous peoples who we otherwise might not have ever come across. From South to North America on over to the islands in the Pacific, from Hawaii to New Zealand and Australia, we can now relate to other indigenous people on a base level as stories and struggles are\xa0shared.\nAmong those Off the Path II writers who were eager to share stories with other indigenous people was Hawaiian Kristiana Kahakauwila. She was selected for the Barnes and Noble\xe2\x80\x99s Discover Great New Writers program for her realistic portrayals in her book of short stories about Hawaiian Natives away from the tourist hotspots, This is Paradise.\nThe young Australia-based writer Ellen van Neerven had won national awards for her debut book of short stories, Heat and Light, and had already been editing and promoting fellow Aboriginal works. When approached about Off the Path II she was eager to contribute to our international collection.\nWe know we are not alone, and we know we are similar not only because of the discrimination and hardships we\xe2\x80\x99ve powered through, but also our ancestor\xe2\x80\x99s pride that fought for their future descendants.\nStill, despite collective tribulations and stereotypes we still face even today, we recognize and embrace our tribal differences. Our identities are not of a one-size-fits-all pan-indigenous nature, but ones of diverse cultures, languages, and geographical differences. Through those intricate lines we\xe2\x80\x99re able to write about our experiences today from distinct points of\xa0view.\nOur identities are not of a one-size-fits-all pan-indigenous nature, but ones of diverse cultures, languages, and geographical differences.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just one story, where a mainstream audience will say, \xe2\x80\x98This is what Indians are like,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Sterling HolyWhiteMountain said about the Off the Path to Indian Country Today Media Network. An Iowa Writers\xe2\x80\x99 Workshop grad, he\xe2\x80\x99s a Blackfeet Indian and contributor to both volumes. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s its value. You get to see different people writing about Indian Country in their own way, and they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it together. I can\xe2\x80\x99t understate the importance of multiple voices. You need a broader spectrum view, because in American society, one Indian speaks for everyone. It happens over and\xa0over.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe anthologies are about how we view the world as we know it and share it to other indigenous peoples through the lens of our own creative control; not what perhaps some so-called Big Five New York publisher or outside editor assumes the Native experience should read like because maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ve previously read Louise Erdrich, other Alexie works, or an aforementioned Native American Renaissance-era book from decades ago and deduced that Native American literature representation had already been fulfilled.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not all Sherman Alexie, he has a very specific voice and he has a very specific experience,\xe2\x80\x9d Crow Indian writer Luella N. Brien said in a Bighorn County News interview, a small town Montana-based newspaper. Luella and her older sibling Eric Leland Bigman Brien contributed to Off the Path Vol.\xa0I.\nShe continued, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Natives in Montana, we have a very different experience from him and yes, we all deal with alcoholism and drug abuse on the reservation, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a cultural difference along with a contemporary view that differs from where he\xe2\x80\x99s from and where we\xe2\x80\x99re from, as well as just being a younger generation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs far as colonizers are concerned, \xe2\x80\x9cIndigenous people are always in the way,\xe2\x80\x9d HolyWhiteMountain noted in a Montana Public Radio segment titled, \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond Sherman Alexie.\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe desires of nations are for resources and land and there just happens to be a group of people here that are in the way of that desire. That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the defining experiences of being indigenous.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhether the non-indigenous audience relates to or gets where our work is coming from or not, we won\xe2\x80\x99t really worry. \nSo whether the non-indigenous audience relates to or \xe2\x80\x9cgets\xe2\x80\x9d where our work is coming from or not, we won\xe2\x80\x99t really worry. After all, our public school systems are already inundated with mandatory reading written by and about whites with the occasional token minority yet books like Alexie\xe2\x80\x99s award-winning The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-time Indian young adult novel are deemed offensive and continually marked to be banned from high school curriculums.\nIn the Off the Path anthologies and like most literary works, there are no guaranteed happily-ever-afters, but there are certainly stories that allowed some of us to creatively breathe out personal demons that may have long plagued our souls as we aimed to intrepidly speak from our hearts as we spilled blood and tears as ink on the book\xe2\x80\x99s pages, just as Spear did when she described fleeing an abusive situation as a child with her mother in a Vol. II story called \xe2\x80\x9cJimtown Ruined My\xa0Life\xe2\x80\x9d:\nStars witnessed our dark escape. The sound of freedom was gravel beneath our feet along a rural Montana highway. I told her, \xe2\x80\x9cMom, breathe. Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry. We\xe2\x80\x99re alright now, Mom.\xe2\x80\x9d She\xe2\x80\x99d squeeze my hand, \xe2\x80\x9cI know.\xe2\x80\x9d She tried to regain composure walking sloppy drunk. Her cries shot through the night sky before she\xe2\x80\x99d inhale quickly and swallow them\xa0again.She hated to leave her other children behind. I did too but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay for them. Mom didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a job, money, a car or house of her own. He isolated her from her family and friends decades ago. I had to make sure that if she felt she had nothing in this entire world, she at least had me by her side. I walked tall. I walked steady. I carried my teddy bear in one hand. In the other, I carried my\xa0heart.\nLakota writer and Off the Path II contributor Dana Lone Hill described in a Partnership With Native Americans interview how she wrote her debut novel about the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Pointing With Lips: A Week In the Life of a Rez Chick, with golf pencils and \xe2\x80\x9cnapkins and anything I could just to keep going\xe2\x80\x9d during a dark time of her life while awaiting sentencing in\xa0jail.\nLone Hill recalled thinking, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not going down like this\xe2\x80\xa6I have so much I am capable of because I am a Lakota woman and came up around strong Lakota women.\xe2\x80\x99 I knew that as soon as I hit freedom, I was going to get my voice out there, and I\xa0have.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor indigenous peoples, love of family and plenty of shared communal humor still arises as life\xe2\x80\x99s primary motivator despite grim statistics that formulate outsider perceptions. \xe2\x80\x9cMost media is about sadness,\xe2\x80\x9d Lone Hill said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe as Indians get through the struggle with laughter. I want people to see that\xe2\x80\x99s who we are, not the romanticized people of Hollywood or the pitiful stories the media portrays us as, but real\xa0people.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhereas humor, heartache, and colonized-based complexities are acknowledged between indigenous cultures through writing, we also might be able to bridge gaps between the non-indigenous world as shared humanity is conveyed.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecolonization and love seem like unlikely partners or unique inner demons,\xe2\x80\x9d Navajo and Off the Path II contributor Bojan Louis noted in an essay about his own childhood trauma titled \xe2\x80\x9cBeauty & Memory & Abuse & Love.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut that, too, is erroneous.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAlthough societal issues may be naturally highlighted throughout the course of a narrative, artistic literature isn\xe2\x80\x99t founded on catering to current political sensitivities, but generally something far more personally transcending.\nTucson-based Off the Path II Blackfeet writer Bill Wetzel navigates a yearning tale of love and companionship that \xe2\x80\x9csauntered\xe2\x80\x9d away from him and left countless unanswered questions in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Maze\xe2\x80\x9d; Paiute and Shoshone writer Kenneth Dyer-Redner contributed \xe2\x80\x9cSmall Tremors,\xe2\x80\x9d a story based on witnessing his grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s struggle with Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s as she tragically sought out her deceased husband of many\xa0years.\nMy own Vol. I story, \xe2\x80\x9cHe Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Know He\xe2\x80\x99s Dead Yet,\xe2\x80\x9d is about the narrator\xe2\x80\x99s brother, who was killed on a cold Montana Indian reservation prairie. That story was based on my own brother\xe2\x80\x99s murder, and I described the anguished cries of the bereaved mother while my own mother\xe2\x80\x99s real-life cries still echoed in my\xa0head.\nIt might technically be fiction, but many readers definitely know it\xe2\x80\x99s real\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8aespecially if they\xe2\x80\x99ve been there too. That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly how they felt when their close friend or relative died as the whole world moved on and seemingly didn\xe2\x80\x99t care or understand.\nThe story understood, however, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we write\xa0them.\n\n\n\nTake a break from the news\nWe publish your favorite authors\xe2\x80\x94even the ones you haven\'t read yet.
