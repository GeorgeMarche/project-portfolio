In fairness, the plan had been to open a lot earlier, but in a story I hear all too often, there were problems with the fit out and then, just as The Collective was due to open in March, along came the COVID-19 shutdown.\nMany would have given up at that point, but not Caversham residents, Sam and Susie, the driving force behind The Collective. Instead they pushed on, The Collective opening in June, initially for takeaway only, before fully opening for table service in mid-September. There\xe2\x80\x99s a brunch menu, which is joined at 11 o\xe2\x80\x99clock by the lunch and toastie menus, all the food cooked in the open kitchen behind the counter. This is backed up by a concise espresso-based menu featuring Extract Coffee Roasters\xe2\x80\x99s Rocket espresso.\nHowever, The Collective\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more than just a caf\xc3\xa9. It\xe2\x80\x99s also a lifestyle store, which reminded me of the likes of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Thoughtfully Caf\xc3\xa9, plus a grocer, selling milk, bread, eggs and more, which brought the likes of Bristol\xe2\x80\x99s No 12 Easton and Elemental Collective to mind.\n Continue reading \n\n\n\nPosted in Breakfast, Cafes, Cake, Laptop Friendly, Lunch, Produce/Food Sales, Reading \n | \n\nTagged Extract, include \n | \n2 Replies\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous Coffee Co.\n\nPosted on October 10, 2020  by  Brian Williams \n\nReply \n\n\nAnonymous Coffee Co., which is located inside the Tasting House on Chain Street, in the heart of Reading, is the latest venture of old friend of the Coffee Spot, Phil Carter. Technically, Anonymous extends no further than the neat wooden counter just inside the door, but in reality you\xe2\x80\x99re free to roam anywhere over the Tasting House\xe2\x80\x99s two floors, including the large upstairs seating area. The Tasting House, by the way, is a wine merchant/wine bar with a range of wines on (self-service) tap, so you can try multiple wines in one sitting if you want.\nReturning to Anonymous, there are two options on espresso (\xe2\x80\x9ccomfort\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cadventure\xe2\x80\x9d) with two more on pour-over through the V60. One espresso and one filter come from Union Hand-roasted, with the others coming from a regularly-changing guest roaster (during my visit, it was Walthamstow\xe2\x80\x99s finest, Wood St Coffee). If you\xe2\x80\x99re hungry, there\xe2\x80\x99s a small range of cakes available from Anonymous, or you can have something from the Tasting House kitchen, which offers toasties, charcuterie, crostini and various bar snacks.\n Continue reading \n\n\n\nPosted in Cake, Coffee & Wine, Coffee Shops, Laptop Friendly, Pubs/Bars, Reading, Saturday Short \n | \n\nTagged include, Union, Wood St \n | \nLeave a Reply\n\n\n\n\nChalk Coffee (COVID-19 Update)\n\nPosted on October 8, 2020  by  Brian Williams \n\n1 \n\n\nOf all the coffee shops that I\xe2\x80\x99ve visited since the COVID-19 restrictions were eased in England, Chalk Coffee can make a claim to be the one with the least physical changes. Located on Watergate Street, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the rapid expansion of Chester\xe2\x80\x99s speciality coffee scene that has seen numbers swell in the last few years. Like many of the city\xe2\x80\x99s speciality coffee shops, it has a basement-like feel, stretching a long way back under the famous Rows and it looks, and feels, remarkably like it did on my last visit in 2019.\nHowever, there have been changes. As well the (admittedly minor) physical ones, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a clear sign outside on the pavement reminding you that you must wear a mask. Meanwhile, there\xe2\x80\x99s a QR code on the counter that you can scan, checking you in on the NHS COVID-19 app. Not all the changes are COVID-19 related though. Chalk Coffee used to use Origin for its house espresso, but it\xe2\x80\x99s recently changed to Colonna Coffee, although Origin is still on decaf, while a regularly-changing guest roaster provides the second espresso option and filter. Meanwhile, if you\xe2\x80\x99re hungry, the usual cast of premade sandwiches and cakes are still available.\n Continue reading \n\n\n\nPosted in Basements, Cafes, Cake, Chester, Coffee Spot Updates, Laptop Friendly, Lunch, Retailers, Sandwiches \n | \n\nTagged Colonna, COVID-19 \n | \n1 Reply\n\n\n\n\nJaunty Goat Update\n\nPosted on October 5, 2020  by  Brian Williams \n\n1 \n\n\nJaunty Goat is one of Chester\xe2\x80\x99s speciality coffee stalwarts, having relocated from a few doors along Bridge Street to its current location in 2015. I first visited in 2016, when it could be fairly described as a coffee shop doing good food, all in a lovely, basement-like interior that extends a long way back under the Rows above. There are even the remnants of a stone staircase in the wall at the back that might date back to the middle-ages.\nJaunty Goat was set up by twins, Patrick and Ed, with Ed leaving in 2018 to establish the nearby Chalk Coffee. Since then, Jaunty Goat has reinvented itself, considerably upping its food game to match the likes of The Flower Cup and Panna, serving a brunch menu until 4 o\xe2\x80\x99clock. It\xe2\x80\x99s also revamped and extended the interior, adding more table seating.\nAt the start of 2019, it opened a second, plant-based, location on Northgate Street, then, after reopening following the easing of the COVID-19 restrictions, Jaunty Goat itself has gone vegetarian. Finally, over the summer, it started roasting its own coffee in a dedicated, off-site roastery, with seasonal single-origin offerings on espresso (house, guest and decaf), plus another on pour-over (AeroPress/V60/Chemex).\n Continue reading \n\n\n\nPosted in Basements, Breakfast, Cafe/Roaster, Cafes, Cake, Chester, Coffee Spot Updates, Laptop Friendly, Lunch, Retailers \n | \n\nTagged jaunty goat \n | \n1 Reply\n\n\n\n\nQuarter Horse Coffee Roasters Update\n\nPosted on October 3, 2020  by  Brian Williams \n\n2 \n\n\nQuarter Horse Coffee opened its Birmingham caf\xc3\xa9/roastery in 2015, the roastery operating on one side of the space, the coffee shop on the other, the two separated by a waist-high counter. While this arrangement had the obvious advantage of making the roastery very visible to the customers, it had its drawbacks. As the roastery became busier, the inevitable interruptions that come from having such an open and visible roasting operation began to have an impact on productivity.\nNathan, the driving force behind Quarter Horse, decided that he need to make some major modifications to improve the roastery. However, the question was how to accommodate the disruption that the structural work would cause, which would inevitably shut both roastery and caf\xc3\xa9 for several weeks. Then along came COVID-19, with its enforced shutdown, giving Nathan his opportunity\xe2\x80\xa6\nThe results of the remodelling were plain for all to see when Quarter Horse reopened on the last day in July. Although it would be more accurate to say that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t plain to see. Although the roastery hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone anywhere, it\xe2\x80\x99s now enclosed in its own room, leaving Nathan and his team free to get on with the important business of roasting in peace.\nThis Coffee Spot Update focuses on the roastery, while the caf\xc3\xa9 has its own update, where you can find more details of the physical changes.\n Continue reading \n\n\n\nPosted in Birmingham, Cafe/Roaster, Coffee Spot Updates, Meet The Roaster, Roastery \n | \n\nTagged quarter horse \n | \n2 Replies\n\n\n\n\nThe Coffee Spot is Eight!\n\nPosted on September 30, 2020  by  Brian Williams \n\nReply \n\n\n2020 has been a very strange year, so much so that I almost forgot the Coffee Spot\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, remembering just in time, late on Monday evening, that the Coffee Spot was eight years old that day. It was, of course, far too late to write anything about it, hence this slightly delayed post. I launched the Coffee Spot on Friday, 28th September 2012 (at 14.15 to be precise) with a vague idea that it might become a useful resource for coffee (shop) lovers and an entertaining way for me to spend (some of) my spare time.\nFor the first five months of the Coffee Spot\xe2\x80\x99s eighth year, things carried on much as before, as I travelled around the world, visiting and writing about all the wonderful coffee shops I found. Then the COVID-19 pandemic struck and everything Coffee Spot related ground to a halt. After quickly running through my backlog of Coffee and Travel Spots, I passed my time writing about making coffee at home. Then, just when I\xe2\x80\x99d pretty much said all I had to say, coffee shops began to reopen, enabling me to write about them again in my COVID-19 updates. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re at another crossroads, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the Coffee Spot\xe2\x80\x99s ninth year will bring\xe2\x80\xa6\n Continue reading \n\n\n\nPosted in Information \n | \nLeave a Reply\n\n\n\n\nKaffeine Eastcastle (COVID-19 Update)\n\nPosted on September 28, 2020  by  Brian Williams \n\n2 \n\n\nIf you ever need evidence that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for operating a coffee shop during the COVID-19 pandemic, I \xc2\xa0present Kaffeine, the London-based chain of precisely two coffee shops. I\xe2\x80\x99ve already looked at how the original Kaffeine, on Great Titchfield Street, has adapted to COVID-19 and today it\xe2\x80\x99s the turn of Kaffeine Eastcastle, which reopened at the start of September. Although less than five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk apart, how the two shops are dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic is quite different.\nOf course, there are similarities, with both adhering to the same underlying principles, but in each case, the response has been moulded to/by the needs of the individual shop. Perhaps the biggest difference is that while Great Titchfield Street offers table service, Eastcastle, with its lower footfall, has a more traditional counter service model.\nIn terms of what\xe2\x80\x99s on offer, little has changed. The espresso-based menu still has Square Mile\xe2\x80\x99s ubiquitous Red Brick at its heart, along with a single-origin option, while there\xe2\x80\x99s also a single-origin filter, which changes monthly. The concise brunch menu is served until 2 pm (3 pm at weekends), supported by an all-day selection of salads, tarts and toasted sandwiches, plus cake, of course.\n Continue reading \n\n\n\nPosted in Breakfast, Cafes, Cake, Coffee Spot Updates, Coffee Terraces, Lunch, Retailers, Sandwiches, West London \n | \n\nTagged COVID-19, Square Mile \n | \n2 Replies\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19: The Next Steps\n\nPosted on September 26, 2020  by  Brian Williams \n\n4 \n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has hit the UK hospitality industry hard, including speciality coffee shops. First came the mandatory shut down of pretty much the whole industry, followed by the slow reopening of a handful of places offering takeout services. Then, following the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in England at the start of July, increasing numbers of coffee shops have reopened around the country. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had the pleasure and the privilege of being able to visit quite a few in places such as London, Reading, Chester, Birmingham and Liverpool, as well as my hometown of Guildford.\nOn the whole, I\xe2\x80\x99ve found that the speciality coffee sector has coped well, but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not out of the woods yet. As we approach the end of September, a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases has led to further countrywide restrictions, plus a wide range of stricter local/regional restrictions.\nThis post looks at the impact of these further restrictions and what they might mean for speciality coffee shops in England as we head into autumn/winter. Please bear in mind that this is just my opinion: you can find specific UK Government advice on-line, while industry bodies such as UKHospitality also publishes its own advice.\n Continue reading \n\n\n\nPosted in Information \n | \n\nTagged COVID-19 \n | \n4 Replies\n\n\n\n\n92 Degrees Coffee (COVID-19 Update)\n\nPosted on September 25, 2020  by  Brian Williams \n\n1 \n\n\n92 Degrees Coffee, Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s first combined speciality coffee shop/roaster, has come a long way since I first visited at the end of 2015. Then it was just a single shop at the top of Hardman Street, the roaster tucked away in a small space behind the counter. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s a chain of three, adding a larger shop in the Baltic Triangle, which does food, and a smaller shop five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk from the original, catering more to the students (and only recently reopened). The roaster has also moved since my original visit, first to the Baltic Triangle, then to a dedicated roastery/office back in the same building on Hardman Street (which, sadly, isn\xe2\x80\x99t open to the public).\nThis update is about the original which looks and feels very much how I remember it from my visit almost five years ago. There are a few COVID-19 changes, such as a thinning out of the seating and a move to disposable cups (so don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to bring your own). However, the basic offering is the same, with the house blend on espresso and three options through the Kalita Wave, along with tea, hot chocolate, plus a selection of cakes, bagels and prepared sandwiches/salads.\n Continue reading \n\n\n\nPosted in Breakfast, Cafe/Roaster, Cafes, Cake, Coffee Spot Updates, Coffee Terraces, Laptop Friendly, Liverpool, Lunch, Retailers, Sandwiches \n | \n\nTagged 92 Degrees, COVID-19 \n | \n1 Reply\n\n\n\n\nGuildford (COVID-19 Update)\n\nPosted on September 23, 2020  by  Brian Williams \n\n1 \n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a busy time, coffee-wise, in my hometown of Guildford, so I thought I would take the unusual step of writing a Coffee Spot Update for the town itself, rather than for each individual coffee shop. Perhaps the most exciting news is that, since the start of September, Guildford has a brand new coffee shop, the Ceylon House of Coffee, which I featured at the start of the week as Monday\xe2\x80\x99s Coffee Spot. However, there have been plenty of other changes, including reopenings, changes of hours and a couple of places opening up their indoor seating. In fact, I think that the only place that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed since I was last in town (in August!) is Canopy Coffee.\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic, Guildford\xe2\x80\x99s speciality coffee scene seems to be doing well. Depending on what you count, Guildford now has six specialty coffee shops, with only the Surrey Hills Coffee pod (serving the offices in London Square) unable to reopen at the moment. As with elsewhere in the country, however, circumstances are still challenging and, in light of recent events, the future is even more uncertain than before, so please do support your local coffee shops if you can.\n Continue reading \n\n\n\nPosted in Coffee Spot Updates, Guildford \n | \n\nTagged COVID-19 \n | \n1 Reply\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n Older posts\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Philosophy of
