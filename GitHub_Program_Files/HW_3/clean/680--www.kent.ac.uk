Key findings from his  work to date include the identification of novel genes on the mouse Y chromosome that affect sperm head shape and fertility; the discovery of a genomic conflict or arms race between the X and Y chromosomes in mice as they compete to influence offspring sex ratio, which in turn has dramatically affected the structural and functional content of both chromosomes; and the identification of mechanisms regulating meiotic and post-meiotic transcriptional silencing of the sex chromosomes. His laboratory investigates the molecular biology of reproduction, the conflicting roles played by sex-linked genes in regulating this process, and the relationship between DNA damage repair mechanisms and the checkpoints governing meiotic progression.\nQualifications:\xa0MA in Medical Sciences, University of Cambridge (1999)\xa0PhD, University of Cambridge (2004)\xa0PGCHE and FHEA (2016)\xa0https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9709-\n\n\nResearch interests\nDNA damage repair in reproduction and cancerMeiotic germ cells and cancer cells share a number of unusual features including the activation of specific genes (the cancer-testis antigens), the ability to tolerate high numbers of DNA strand breaks without undergoing apoptosis, and (in oocytes) a lowered stringency spindle assembly checkpoint that permits cell division even in the presence of unattached kinetochores. Dr Ellis studies the intracellular mechanisms that monitor DNA damage and chromosomal alignment during cell division in order to understand how these are perturbed in disease states.\xa0The role of Yq-linked genes in fertility and offspring sex ratioMouse chromosome arm Yq is highly ampliconic, with Yq-linked genes being present in up to ~600 copies. Deletions on Yq (Yqdel) titrate the copy number level of the ampliconic genes on this chromosome arm. Yqdel males show a dose-dependent fertility phenotype, with smaller deletions leading to mild teratozoospermia and larger deletions leading to severe teratozoospermia and infertility. In the fertile males with smaller deletions, there is an offspring sex ratio skew in favour of females. Since X and Yqdel-bearing sperm are produced in equal numbers, the skew must be due to differential fertilising capacity between X-bearing and Yqdel-bearing sperm. Dr Ellis\xe2\x80\x99 work in this model system is aimed at clarifying the physiological basis of the sex ratio skew, and understanding the molecular functions of the Yq-encoded genes that regulate sex ratio.\xa0Mechanisms of non-Mendelian inheritanceThe earliest genetic concept taught in schools is Mendel\xe2\x80\x99s First Law of Segregation: that you have two copies of each gene, and an equal chance of passing on either of the copies. Dr Ellis studies how and why Mendel\xe2\x80\x99s Law breaks down, allowing meiotic drive genes \xe2\x80\x93 so-called genetic outlaws \xe2\x80\x93 to bias the reproductive lottery and promote their own inheritance. Key questions to resolve are how many driving genes there are, where they are in the genome, and how they work.\xa0\n\n\nTeaching\nDr Ellis teaches on a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate coursesGenetics and Evolution - BI324\xa0The Genome - BI549\xa0 (from Spring 2019/20, module convenor)\xa0Research Project - BI600\xa0\xa0Integrated Endocrinology and Metabolism - BI626\xa0\xa0The Science of Reproductive Medicine - BI841\xa0MSc Project - BI845\xa0 (module convenor)\xa0Landscapes of the Future - PO681\xa0 (guest seminar)\xa0\xa0\n\n\nSupervision\nMSc-R projects available for 2020/21both projects below joint supervision with Dr Tim FentonHow does wrongful expression of germline genes drive HPV cancer pathology?\nThe cancer-testis antigens are a set of genes whose expression is normally restricted to the male germline, with a diverse set of functions including cell proliferation, meiotic recombination and chromatin remodelling.  Strikingly, these genes are also upregulated in a range of different cancers, where they are believed to promote cell proliferation, apoptosis resistance and genome instability via as yet uncharacterised mechanisms.  This project will examine the role of one such gene, SYCP2 in the pathogenesis of epithelial cancers (cervical and oral) associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection.\nAdditional research costs: \xc2\xa31500\xa0Are Y-linked genes the explanation for the differential prevalence of certain cancers between men and women?\nMany cancers show differential prevalence between men and women, including head and neck cancers associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. The Y-linked oncogene Rbmy \xe2\x80\x93 a splicing factor that regulates multiple downstream mRNAs \xe2\x80\x93 has previously been associated with sex differences in liver cancer prevalence. This study will test whether this also holds true for HPV-driven cancer, and investigate Rbmy\xe2\x80\x99s potential downstream targets in either or both model systems as appropriate.\xa0Additional research costs: \xc2\xa31500\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast updated 17 July 2020\n\n\nPage footer\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRecruitment and admissions:\nCall us on +44 (0)1227 764000\nAll contacts\n\n\nUniversity of Kent\nCanterbury\nKent\nCT2 7NZ\n\n\n\n\nVisit us\n\nAll open days and visits\nMaps and directions\n\n\n\nSocial media links\n\n\n\nConnect with us on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect with us on LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to us on Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to us on TikTok\n\nTikTok logo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampuses and centres\n\nCanterbury\nMedway\nParis\nBrussels\n\n\n\nCampuses and centres\n\n\n\nCanterbury\nMedway\n\nParis\nBrussels\n\n\n\nmap-marker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmap-marker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmap-marker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\nAbout us\nResearch\nGovernance and planning\nAccess agreements\nTransparency return\nModern Slavery Act Statement\nCharity information\nLocations\nSupport us\nWhat's on\nNews\nBusiness services\nCareer opportunities\n\n\n\nStudy\n\nCourses\nUndergraduates\nPostgraduates\nInternational students\nPart-time and short courses\nStudent experience\nAccommodation\nFees and funding\nScholarships\nTerm dates\n\n\n\nInformation for\n\nApplicants\nParents and family\nStudents\nStaff\nAlumni\nBusiness and partners\nPaying online\n\n\n\n\nTEF Gold Award\n\nAffiliations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther links\n\n\xa9 University of Kent\nAccessibility\nContact us\nFeedback\nLegal\nCookies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tWe use cookies to improve your experience on our site.
