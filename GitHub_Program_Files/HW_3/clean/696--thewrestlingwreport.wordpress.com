Cobb launched Ishii with an exploder that looked great. They landed strikes and suplex and both sold them fantastically. Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s standing moonsault is really impressive. Ishii is the best seller inContinue reading \xe2\x80\x9cREVIEW: G1 Climax 30 Nights 13 & 14 (Oct 10-11\xc2\xa02020)\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOctober 13, 2020October 13, 2020 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUncategorized\t\t\t\t\t\n\nREVIEW: NJPW G1 Climax Nights 11 & 12 (Oct 7-8\xc2\xa02020) Night 11 Tomohiro Ishii defeated Yujiro Takahashi: Yujiro was pretty intense here, maybe my favourite performance from him. He is in the Fale role and he\xe2\x80\x99s much much better at it. Ishii clearly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going all out here, but Yujiro is the night-off in A Block.

It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t great or anything but it was a good opener. Maybe Takahashi\xe2\x80\x99s best match except Suzuki. 3.5 Jeff Cobb defeated Jay White: Cobb is unbelievably strong.

Suzuki is on fire and his matches are always so intense. Yujiro brought some energy too and this was one of his better efforts so far. 3.75 Kota Ibushi defeated Jeff Cobb: Ibushi is a great seller and he worked really hard to getContinue reading \xe2\x80\x9cREVIEW: NJPW G1 Climax 30 Nights 7 & 8 (Sept 30 \xe2\x80\x93 Oct 1\xc2\xa02020)\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOctober 11, 2020October 11, 2020 \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tLoad more posts\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLoading\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSomething went wrong.
