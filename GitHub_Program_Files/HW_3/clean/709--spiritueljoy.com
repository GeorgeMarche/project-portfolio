An exceptionally sunny day for cold December. If you live in the Himalayas, then sunny days and December are cool. If you live in the polluted NCR and work a corporate job, then sunny days are like little miracles in December and then in January. I hadnt seen the sun since days, weeks maybe. My hair was wet. I wanted to go to the office rooftop and just enjoy the sun for a few minutes. Too bad, I had to wait about one and a half hours to do so.\nAnyway, I was there in the sun. The maddening sun that I love. It was a dirty rooftop. Yuck! Like rooftops always are, in such crumpled old and dirty buildings. I hate such buildings. They can be old but not that dirty. I hate dirty things like this. It makes me feel disturbed.\nThe office boy is always unwilling to work. Things are always lying around. He never picks them up. He hates it actually.\nComing back to my aversion to dirty places. The office is weird I say. So messed up that I instantly lose motivation entering that space. It is as if I have been thrown into some place bad. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be there. \nThat smell. That weird smell this place has. Like something is slowly degenerating. Slowly losing animation. Everything is lying everywhere. Everything is messed up. \nEverything looks like it was a piece of someones soul, brutally snatched and preserved for no reason other than a sense of achievement. I always feel like that when I look at hundreds of visiting cards lying on the tables.\nAt least the office can be cleaned once in a while. This rooftop is beyond hope. There is nothing that can be done about it. Dirt and dust everywhere. The railing was full of dust. Some old dust, some pigeon shit on the dust and the some more dust on the pigeon shit. \nMore such specimens lying on the railing. I cant lean on that railing. I have this maddening urge to lean on railings, let my hair fall down and then just look at the ground and imagine what would happen if I fell down. Sounds like fun, hope that never happens. \nThe metro is barely a few meters away from this railing. In fact, this building is a triangle on the side. On one end, the distance between the metro line and the building becomes so small that you could easily do some small timey stunt stuff on a bike and expect to be dead the next moment unless there is a net down there, waiting to catch you when you fall. \nToo bad, life is not about finding nets that catch you when you fall. Nets have a life and emotions and all and they are not always available for instant help. They may come later though, when you are dead and long gone. A net may not be in the right mood to be where it was needed, long, long ago.\nThen I look at the pigeons. Oh those weird birds sitting on those weird wires. These metro wires. Pigeons are always sitting on wires. They dont have another job. Just sit on wires. I am not fond of pigeons I say. Sitting and shitting is all they do. I wonder what do they even find to eat in this dirty place. \nAre they all domesticated? They can fly. They have wings. They just take a small round flight over the metro rail wires and come back to where they started. \nWhy dont they fly away? What keeps them glued to the wires? Do they like being domesticated? Are they afraid of the world beyond this small section of the metro wires they call home? Do they stay by choice or because they have no other choice?\nThe sun has almost burnt my back by now. My hair is not just dry, it is literally fuming. I have to go down to the weird smelly space again. There is ginger tea waiting for me down there. A relief or smell and taste in an otherwise tasteless, smelly world.\n\n\nPosted in MusingsTagged Musings philosophyLeave a comment \n\n\n\n \n\nLose Some Weight Woman! (Or Maybe Not)\n\nPosted on November 17, 2019November 17, 2019 by NehaJoyChauhan \n\n\nI know several women with PCOS. Most of them struggle with weight gain. There are countless others who remain slim but struggle with the same problems as us- the overweight ones. I dont know what to tell them when they ask questions. I dont know how to explain that I wanted to lose weight and maybe look like them. I am wrong, I know. \nPCOS is crippling whether you are slim or overweight. It wouldnt really matter what your scale says as long as you constantly lose hair, your skin becomes an arid desert and your periods keep playing hide and seek with you. \nI wanted to write a post about PCOS weight loss but decided to take a more balanced approach to weight issues this time. My trigger was an enthusiastic Instagrammer who was constantly posting images of her food, trying to tell the world about a PCOS-friendly diet. I must say that I was impressed. What she is doing is truly commendable and we must all support her in her endeavor. However, my only problem was that her PCOS-friendly food matched with my conventional wisdom, but not my insights into Ayurveda. My little ghost of personal experience shouted in my ear- this wont work. \nThis wont work\nI thought that I should tell her that these things didnt work for me but I didnt want to kill her enthusiasm. She is suffering, just like me and I dont have the heart to tell her that the things she is working so hard for never worked for me or for anyone else I knew. And secretly, I prayed that it worked for her because PCOS is that bad. \nUnderstanding food\nBefore I start talking about my personal experience and an entire decade of research I have done into PCOS, I feel obliged to tell you something honestly. I havent yet found a diet that works perfectly for me. There is no food category that I have not given up on, only to find that the scale staying stubbornly where it was before I started the diet. What I have found is that PCOS doesnt spring from one root cause and thats why you need a multi-pronged approach to handle this problem. \nSo lets understand it now. What is food?\nFood is nourishment. When I was younger, I tried to understand food in terms of calories. Anything below 200 calories is good, anything over 200 calories is bad. I was going crazy about negative calories, salads and food hacks hoping that it would help me lose weight. It didnt. \nSo lets just chuck the calorie-counting system. 300 calories of almonds and 300 calories of chicken are not the same because they are not the same thing. Also, you shouldnt believe that you will magically replace calories with seemingly healthier foods and get better periods or hormone health. It doesnt work that way. IT JUST DOESNT. \nLooking at food qualitatively\nMy first advice to any girl suffering from PCOS is to look at food qualitatively, not quantitatively. Our body is a biological system, not a mechanical one. So dont believe that 300 calories of chicken will have the same effect as 300 calories of almonds. Of course, the calories are the same but the impact is completely different. \nTo look at food qualitatively, my first weapon was to understand chemical composition. You know how it went- really bad. Then I turned to Ayurveda and found my answers. \nNow, Ayurveda suggests that there are three elements or humors-\nVata- predominantly air\nPitta- predominantly fire\nKapha- predominantly water\nI will explain how these humors work in great detail in the next post. For now, we must understand that foods, just like our body, have three qualities- vata, pitta and kapha. The idea is to balance these three qualities and ensure that we remain healthy. \nWhat should you eat?\nI cant give you a Bible for the right food for PCOS and expect you to follow it like a religion. Every body is different. Every situation is different and every geographical location is different. \nWhat? Where did geography come in PCOS? Read on to know. \nFocus on local staples\nThe first thing is to check what kind of food is staple in your part of the world. This is the kind of food that is best suited to your lifestyle. For instance, I live in a Himalayan valley where we dont use coconut oil for cooking. We experience winter for at least a quarter of an year so cooking with coconut oil is a no-no. (BTW, I have had a number of arguments with North Americans on Twitter who believe that using tropical oils like coconut oil for cooking will magically heal them. Sorry! You live in a relatively colder environment. Coconut oil isnt natural for your body and cannot become a staple.)\nHere, we use mustard oil primarily. Ghee is also common. Now, if you are living in Southern India, please dont listen to stuff like healthy rice bran oil, canola oil and what not. If coconut oil is the staple oil, dont go anywhere else. \nThere is one other great point to note here. South India is a tropical paradise where there is heat and humidity. Coconut oil brings a thandi taseer or coolness to food which works well in that environment. In Northern India, applying coconut oil on your head is a punishment in winter. Because it is so cold during some months, we would rather use mustard oil which is locally sourced, available in plenty and has a garam taseer or warmth. \nUnderstand vata, pitta, kapha\nAccording to Ayurveda, PCOS is primarily a kapha disorder. However, whenever we treat a disease by Ayurvedic means, we first try to balance air, which is the lightest element. \nVata also carries your prana or life force or your breath. If vata is aggravated, you will find typical symptoms of dryness like flaky scalp and skin, dehydrated skin, constipation etc. Vata aggravation also leads to sleep troubles in many women. \nPitta is your life fire or your digestive fire or jathar agni. Pitta aggravation leads to heat build up. fevers, pimples etc.  Excessive acidity, belching, breakouts etc. are all pitta issues. \nKapha is the holy water content of your body. Kapha aggravation causes heaviness, digestive issues, slow metabolism, sluggishness, fatigue etc. It makes it hard to get out of bed. \nUnderstand what specific types of symptoms you are facing and wait for my next article. If you cant, DM me on Instagram. \nDont listen to shitty advice\nThe market is full of crooks who just want to sell you a product and make a buck. They will tell you a tea balances your hormones, a superfood combats period problems and a customized shampoo will magically solve all your hair troubles from the first wash. This is not how it works. Trust me. \nThey will tell you rice bran oil is good for weight loss or that green matcha beans (or whatever they are called) are great for staying in shape. None of this matters. You dont need to eat oatmeal and quinoa. You dont need to spend a fortune on buying food that tastes like absolute BS and doesnt give you any satisfaction. \nYou just need to focus on locally sourced, locally viable. Just eat what you regularly eat. Eat what is cooked at home and make sure that you eat seasonally. Thats it. There is no other way to be healthy and if you need to lose some weight, you have to do it this way. \nCome on, you are being stupid now\nI knew you would say this. I knew you would think this is stupid. We have been conditioned to believe certain things and you are not the only one who is struggling to understand how the regular daal-roti will make you lose weight and stay healthy. I struggled too. But the heart of the matter is that no diet that you come across can be continued everyday, forever. One day you will break and the devastation will be enough to break an artificial cycle and bring you back on the path of bloating, fat gain and probably a lot of pains and aches. \nTake food as a means of sustenance. Dont just change your food, change your relationship with food. Taking up a new diet every time you fail at a previous one, thinking that a new diet would somehow be more surreal is like jumping from one failed relationship to another without taking a step back and thinking why each of our relationships fail. \nI could go on writing, you know. But lets save it for next Monday. \xf0\x9f\x99\x82\n\n\nPosted in PCOSTagged PCOS PCOS help PCOS weight lossLeave a comment \n\n\n\n \n\nThe Dirty Secrets Behind a Life With PCOS\n\nPosted on November 10, 2019 by NehaJoyChauhan \n\n\n\nThe idea of feminity & womanhood is rooted in our beauty and our ability to bear children. Unfortunately, when you are diagnosed with PCOS, both these ideas go down the drain. At the\xa0risk of being repetitive here is what I want to say-PCOS Sucks!Waking up every day with an\xa0unexplained pain and a stubble that would rival your brother\xe2\x80\x99s is not a pleasant experience. The weighing machine doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add to your confidence either. It appears that the scale could only move in one direction- right. Like the arrow of time, it keeps moving indefinitely in one direction no matter how hard you try to slim down. \nAnd the acne? Don\xe2\x80\x99t even get me started. If I have time after counting all the hair follicles I lost, I will tackle the acne issue. \nIt starts with this\nI was first diagnosed with PCOS 10 years ago when my periods suddenly threw a tantrum. It baffled me. My period was as serious about its job as a 9 to 5 employee on a Monday. It lasted only a few hours, and it scared me. As a college student living away from home, this was a nightmare. The first thing I did was rush back home and visit the gynae with my mother. \nThe result was shocking- I had PCOS, a weird syndrome that messes up with your periods, literally f****s your entire system and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t let you conceive. I was not disenchanted or shattered. I was confused. How did this happen? Why me? What the hell did I do to deserve this?\nI will share the emotional toll it took on me on some other day. Long story short- I was a confused, disappointed and anxious teen who was taking tons of medications and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if there was a way out. \nHonestly speaking, THERE ISN\xe2\x80\x99T. \nThere is hope\nThe good news is that the last decade made me suffer so much that I have finally found a routine I could stick to. It is sustainable, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me starve and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t let me live solely on medications. Previously, I have written a few articles about PCOS and also shared my personal experiences on Quora. However, I think now is the opportune time for me to share more. With so hundreds of girls being diagnosed with PCOS, it would be futile for me to watch from the sidelines. \nI have seen tons of PCOS related blogs, YouTube videos and Instagram posts. They all sell magical remedies and solutions and believe that if you could just lessen your carbs, or just walk for 30 minutes or just stop using chemical-infused products, your PCOS will be magically cured. \nAgain, THIS IS NOT TRUE. \nThe number of such articles and videos is growing at a rapid pace. I think a girl going through emotional turmoil and psychological issues related to PCOS should not drown herself in stupid and discouraging messages. You should also not stick to false hopes. \nI have had PCOS for 10 years and it feels like I have only started to understand my body and condition now. \nIn the next few posts, I will share all the nitty-gritties of my experience with you. For now, I will focus only on the most devastating parts of PCOS. \nHow PCOS literally ruins your life\nEverybody has a life-altering moment and mine was a PCOS diagnosis. This happened before I started my business, before I started working on my dreams and before I had my first job. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so soon?,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. All the stories I read were about people hustling, living their life, working tirelessly on their dreams and finally realizing that their health has suffered. \nMy health? Well, it suffered long before I could even properly lay the foundation to my career. It was devastating. \nHere is all I faced, in all its ugly glory. \nAll my hair problems\nThere are two things I hate the most about having PCOS- facial hair and hair loss. It is a vicious cycle  you are losing your precious mane from the head while growing a manly, coarse, and dark beard. Mine wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a full beard but the hair on the chin was enough to make me go crazy. \nI used everything I possibly\xa0could- wax, trimmers, epilators and even hair removal creams. Yeah! I know they are not to be used on the face but I used them. I just wanted to get rid of that hair. Sometimes I would trim my facial hair at night only to find a slightly longer stubble in the morning. It breaks you. \nAt the same time,\xa0the hair on your head is falling. There is no way you can hide a bald patch on the hair. You can\xe2\x80\x99t do any creative hairstyles to hide it, because it would break more hair. You can\xe2\x80\x99t wear caps. Damn! you can\xe2\x80\x99t even comb your hair. The more you comb, the more hair you lose. It is futile to share the problem with people. You are literally going bald and all everyone can do is tell you different home remedies that never work. \nThe period issue\nYou never really realize how important something is unless its gone. I realized that with my period. I didnt hate my period\xc2\xa0as such. It was never an inconvenience. It never hurt. I barely felt any cramps. My period date was just another day in my life. But then it all changed. I started keeping track of every period, waiting anxiously for the next one. \nI would spend my days in stress, wondering what must be going on in my ovaries. I would constantly think about having better periods and bringing things back to normal. They never really came back to normal. \nI was taking HRT (hormonal replacement therapy) or birth control pills that were making my acne worse. My periods were on time but they smelled foul, ached like hell, and crippled me partially for three days each month. If you saw me during the medication phase, you would have pitied me- a lot. \nThe constant stress\nAt one point I felt like I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a proper woman, but not quite a man. I felt like I was trapped somewhere in between. It was chipping away at my mental peace. I wanted to build a business and the stress of handling it was already big enough. Coupled with my bad health, it was truly a bad place to be. \nThe headaches were rough and frequent and my eyes were constantly watery. Talking to several people, ensuring that work was good quality, and that everyone was paid on time all the while praying to get my period on time was nothing\xa0short of\xa0a herculean task. \nNow I realize I was a fool to try to accomplish so many things together. I should have taken some time out, given by dreams the back seat and worked on myself before everything else. \nThe worse of it all was seeing pregnant women or newborns. I was never thrilled about the\xa0idea\xa0of\xa0motherhood. I always thought that\xa0it would happen at the right time and I will focus on it if and when\xa0I get married. But at that time\xa0I was crying. \nI didnt feel jealous of any woman, no. I felt inadequate, incomplete. \nAt one time, I desperately wanted to have a baby to make myself believe that I am worth it. To make myself believe that I wasn\xe2\x80\x98t inadequate, that I was complete. \nI thank myself for slapping some sense back to me and not making any radical decisions that would hurt me even more. Even if I had a child then, I would still be terrible. A child is a huge responsibility and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been a good mother then. \nThis journey doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end here\nI shared with you my three dirty secrets of living with PCOS in brief. There is a lot more to talk about and a lot more to share. I will try to post regularly. Though I initially thought about posting two articles every week, I now think that\xc2\xa0my busy work schedule may not allow me to write such long posts twice a week. I will write at least once a week and if I write more, I will update you.

A few hours ago I entered this building. The sun had just started to shine in its full glory and as I entered the building, my eyes took a little time to adjust to the lights that somehow shine brighter than the sun, within this old and crappy building. \nI spend the day working- noticing a thin layer of dust on the window sill, experiencing the bland taste of the food I eat, feeling the cold stainless steel touch my tongue and lips as I eat with a spoon, staring at the yellow, crooked teeth of the person sitting right in front of me. Uh! If there is anything I hate in this world, it is crooked teeth, especially when they are stained yellow because of constant smoking. This dull, bland food and your crooked teeth uggghh my eyes need cleansing. I need acid. \nI went to pick up some stationery in the supply room and just as I got my hands  on the on the rim of white paper, I noticed a spider web on the top right corner of this weird old shelf.  I looked around to find something to clear it and found nothing. So I carefully removed one piece of shiny, bright, spotless white paper to gently swipe the web away. \nBlame the short height, I had to stand on my toes to reach the corner. I couldnt, it seemed obvious. But in my effort to reach the crappy old right corner of that crappy old shelf, I almost fell right on the shelf. Pixie dust sprinkled from the crappy old top of the shelf right on my head and powdered the tip of my nose along with the white papers. Just then, out of pure instinct mixed with disgust, I wiped my nose and then the paper.\nWhat a mess! Now I dont have dust particles on my face and papers, I have dust waves. \nThe day passes like it never existed and light in this crappy old building made me believe it was still daytime.  What? 6 p.m. already? I need to go out of this building. There may still be some sunshine. I havent lost my sunshine yet. It is exactly how I left it when I entered this crappy old building. I pack my bag in haste and rush outside only to find that its dark outside. \nA lightening bolt hit my heavy heart. \nIts 6 p.m. woman. What did you expect?\nI expected sunshine but its dark outside. \n\n\nPosted in MusingsTagged dystopia fables millennial short storyLeave a comment \n\n\n\nIts A Hard Knock Life\n\nPosted on September 15, 2019September 15, 2019 by NehaJoyChauhan \n\n\nThere is a movie called Annie that I so dearly love. It is about an orphan named Annie, who is adventurous, courageous and scarily optimistic about life. Sometimes she gets sad but when adversity knocks her door, Annie finishes her chores like a boss, sings Its a Hard Knock Life and plans her escape from the orphanage. \nHere is the song, just in case-\n\n\n\nI must say I have a thing for musicals but this is my favorite. \nSo why am I talking about a hard knock life on a September Sunday, when the temperatures seem to fluctuate more often than a PMSing womans moods? \nIts because I want to talk about it today. Its because I have a newfound appreciation for what I write and its because I have started to realize that I need to write more than I think. To get some background on that state of mind, click to read The Right Shift At An Opportune Moment.\nAnyway, lets get back to topic. \nWhy is this a hard knock life?\nIt is no longer about responsibilities. Humans are pretty adept at handling responsibilities, especially if you are an Indian. We are aware about our responsibilities in life from a very young age and grow very comfortable with them as we grow older.  Responsibilities are not making life harder. \nThat job is reserved for obligations.\nSooo many different types of obligation hovering over these responsible shoulders that sometimes it becomes difficult to find the self- just like it becomes difficult to find a needle in the haystack. \nDont get me wrong. I am not demeaning the struggles of millions of poor and underprivileged people. They are being served the shorter end of the stick. I am talking about the uneasiness of a privileged life. We dont sleep empty belly, we have clothes to wear, more than a couple of shoe pairs and maybe festive dresses too that we dont like to repeat. \nI am talking about that emptiness you feel in your heart when your belly is full and so is your mind. Even after fulfilling all the responsibilities and obligations that come our way, we still have to feel this emptiness, this void. \nAn obligation after an obligation\nI am obliged to laugh at my boss jokes. Alright, understandable. That guy signs my paychecks. \nI am obliged to tell my wife that she is looking pretty. Alright, understandable. She is my wife after all and it is my duty to keep her happy. \nI am obliged to tell my husband I love him and dont look at another man. Alright, understandable. Men have feelings and they are sensitive too. \nI am obliged to tell my parents that I love them and sometimes I will give in to some of their demands that make zero sense to me. Alright, understandable. They are my parents after all. \nBut why I do I have to share condolence messages on social media every time a celebrity dies? It doesnt make a difference to my life. If they had a profound impact on my psyche, thats a totally different thing but not everyone does that. \nWhy am I obliged to wish you Happy Birthday. I dont even know you. \nWhy am I obliged to see pictures of film stars getting married? WTF, take it out of my sight. \nThese obligations are not always self-imposed. They are imposed by the media and this huge market we are living in where we are both the consumer and the consumed. So if some random celeb gets married, my timeline is filled with their pictures. Why? Oh god, why? My curiosity about your wedding is non-existent and even if it exists, it can be satiated with a couple of pictures. I dont want to feel obliged to see their pictures because a random algorithm decides that this is what people of my age and gender. living in my particular locality will be interested in. \nThere is a constant obligation to conform to some norms. You have to look a certain way, draw your eyebrows a certain way (draw your ****ing eyebrows?), wear a certain color because of my complexion, a certain style because of my body shape, use a certain shampoo because of my hair type WHY?\nWhy am I obliged to watch news that consists of useless panels of guests screaming at each other,shouting their propaganda?\nWhy am I obliged to participate in this mess?\nLife is hard you know\nThe life that our parents and grandparents lived wasnt easier in any way. It involved labor and toil and struggles and what not. I cant romaticize the past. It is worthless. Every decade, every generation has its problems. Ours is that of an over-occupied mind.\nOur problem is that our mind is like a Boeing Jet. It is overbooked and all passengers show up for the flight. You are stuck in a state of inertia because too many people are waiting for their flight. They WANT YOUR ATTENTION and you are obliged to give it to them. So you overload the flight with extra passengers and luggage, praying to any Holy spirit, any god, any higher power to safely land at your destination. \nIn the evening, you eventually reach the destination but your jet is suddenly emptied of its load and now it is feeling exhausted. Your mind is so tired that you cant fall asleep. So you do what good jet pilots do- surf social media networks. \nNext day, you are tired, your jet is quite exhausted and lo and behold! the flight is overbooked again. \nYou are smart enough to realize what will happen to that jet and that pilot, right?\nThe same is happening with our minds. So many obligations arising out of nowhere, everything demanding your attention. Oh! that Diwali sale! oh EOSS! oh! 50% off. Oh! this, Oh! that. \nIt feels crazy because you are not in control of these obligations. It would take a lot of effort to ensure that they bother you a little less and who has the energy to achieve one more task on an otherwise busy day. \nShradhs have started. Navratri is upcoming. \nRemember that one guy/girl who you have never met in your life and dont intend to get to know in the future? They are getting married and you have to buy new clothes and shoes for your family so you can attend that wedding. You know why? Because obligations. \nGood luck!\n\n\nPosted in MusingsTagged generation gap millennial movie obligations sick society social norms societyLeave a comment \n\n\n\nThe Right Shift At An Opportune Moment\n\nPosted on September 7, 2019 by NehaJoyChauhan \n\n\nIt is interesting how things change with time. It is interesting how change sometimes is not a force but a gradual transition towards what you ultimately desire. \nIn April this year, I took down my original website because it was getting harder by the day to ensure that I was writing frequently. I was finding it harder to connect, harder to share, harder to express. No doubt there was also some kind of hesitancy. Then there is always that excuse  I didnt have the time.\nBut the time between April and August was the only time in my life (since 2010 i believe) that I did not have an active running blog. It first felt liberating. No more items to check off. One less responsibility but eventually it felt like a void that I would always be unable to fulfill. That is where this blog comes into play. \nWith 28 years of my life, now things seem to have finally reached a destination where I can say that yes, I can now describe what I do, what I aspire for and who I really am. Anything that happened before this was sometimes a foolish attempt to make mistakes that I would be proud of or a desperate attempt to fit in with the crowd. Everything. \nBut now things will change. And yes, they will change for sure. I will write about things that I have known and felt, things that I stand for and things that I REALLY want to share with the world. I am not sure yet if I want to publish any more of my poems and fables online but hopefully I will get some clarity on that soon. \nSome people will say that my writing style is unusual. Trust me, I have tried to change but this is where it eventually ends up.  I know why this is important to me to stick to how I write. I write with my heart. I dont really plan things when I write. I just know that I have to. Something strikes my mind, evokes emotions and words in my heart and creates a mighty hurricane that has to hit land (in this case a paper or this screen). \nI write because I write because I write. \nFor the past 8 years (well almost 8 years) I have written countless articles for clients- all structured well in advance, all great to read, all paid well for. But the problem is that those articles dont define my thought process properly. So yes, if these articles that I write in moments of frenzy are scattered, haywire and such- so be it. \n\n\nPosted in UncategorizedTagged change thoughtsLeave a comment \n\n\n\n\n\n7 Favorite Rumi Quotes & My Musings\n\nPosted on March 14, 2019 by NehaJoyChauhan \n\n\nRumi is of\ninternets most famous poets. This Persian poet has done a lot for the\nromantics, giving them hope, helping them solve life troubles and even get the\ncourage to face life. The courage and confidence that Rumi quotes can instill\nin you are par excellence. I first came into contact with his writings when I\nhad just started exploring Sufism- a mystical branch of Islam. Some call it\nesoteric while the other define it as mystical, magical.\nRumi quotes are all\naround the internet now. Everyone knows what you seek is seeking you. The\nwest is somehow enthralled with the idea of some magical romantic poet who\nexisted centuries ago. Sufism should not be confused with primitive\nromanticism, even though they share some similarities. When you read about\nSufism a little more, you find that the roots of this practice is in fact a\nservice to the almighty. If you think Rumi quotes only define a certain aspect\nof life, like love, you may want to think again.\nEverybody will have a different meaning for whatever they have heard or read about Rumi. An essential part of writing and expressing through any art form is to let the viewer, listener or your audience define a meaning for what they have read, seen or heard. I will be dedicating this post to 7 of my favorite Rumi quotes and what they mean to me.\nLife is a balance between holding on and letting go\n\nLife indeed is about\nbalance. You will often come across feelings that are no longer serving their\npurpose and people who are not important in your life. No, it is not about you\nbeing a bad person. People change and so do circumstances. All the people we\nknow have a certain role to play in our lives and hence, they must all be\nacknowledged for it. However, it makes no sense to keep holding on to them,\nlong after they are gone. Hold on to what is important now. Hold on to what\nyour heart thinks is dear to you right now and leave the old aside.\nWe cannot walk with dead weight on our shoulders. Why are walking with emotional baggage then? Let it go.\nThe only lasting beauty is the beauty of the heart\n\nThe beauty of the\nface will fade with time. Your body will start experiencing troubles. You will\nnever be the same when you grow older. It will all fade away and we will become\na monument to our former selves, suggesting nothing but what had been. Why run\nafter the beauty of the skin then? Real beauty lies right inside your heart. It\nwill last forever.\nA pure heart must\nnot be contaminated with the vices of the world.\nThe heart must learn\nto love and be loved by others too. The heart must know that its goodness\ncannot be corrupted by anyone else. It needs nothing but a steady supply of\nlove and compassion to grow into a beautiful space for the loved one to live\nin.\nNo matter how old your body gets, the heart will continue to shine. If you love deeply and truly, the heart will age backwards. Trust me. This happens. You can live a wonderful live, a healthy and happy life, only if you maintain the beauty of your heart.\nIt is rain that grows flowers, not thunder\n\nWhat is the\ndifference between building a room and planting flowers? Have you ever imagined\nwhat could be the only difference between these two similar practices that\ncreate a beautiful, living flower and a building where people can go to work\nbut with no life of its own?\nThe construction\nworker and the gardener work with equal strength, equal patience and equal hard\nwork. They use the materials made of mother earth to get the end result and\nyet, one gets life and the other is lifeless. Why?\nIt is because the\ngardener is providing something more human to the plant. He is nurturing the\nflower with love. You must have come across gardeners who are not as dedicated\nto their plants. People who dont love their plants do not produce that sweet\nsmelling rose that can enlighten a lovers heart. You can use all your craft to\ncreate a beautiful plantation or a beautiful building, but it is the feeling of\nnurturing care that would make your flower look and smell beautiful.\nThis Rumi quote has helped me understand relationships and parenting. Truly, you need to nurture whatever you have with all the love and care in the world. It could thunder a little while it is raining, but it will not rain a little when it is thundering all the time. You can decide. How do you want your relationships to move further? Do you want thunder or rain?\nThe art of knowing is knowing what to ignore\n\nDo we really know\nall that is there to know in the world? No.\nThe idea that I\nreceived from this quote was to ensure that I stay away from negative people\nand negative talk in my life. There is an overwhelming amount of fear and\nnegativity in the air. There are toxic people, toxic thoughts, toxic ideologies\nand poisoning exchange of words between people. Can I really make my way\nthrough this maze? Yes I can.\nI choose to ignore\nwhat harms my balance. No, I do not ignore criticism. If you know better than\nme and want to help me in bettering myself, you are most welcome. We will\ncreate something that is good for everyone. I might fight for my ideas and you\ncan fight for them too. We can talk, we can share ideas. However, I will not\nlet you fill my mind with toxic thoughts about myself. You cant feed me\nnegative news, full of fear and hatred and expect me to react. I wont. I dont\nfeed myself such thoughts. As a result, now I only read news. I barely ever\nwatch news. I am more selective with what the mass media is trying to feed my\nbrain. Hence, I feel good.\nDont grieve. Anything you lose comes around in another form\n\nIn many mystical\nIndian traditions, the human body is referred to as mitti. This hindi word\nmeans earth. The human is made of mitti or earth and when he dies, he goes\nback to the earth. His body becomes one with the land he was born in. His soul\nthen recreates another human form with the same earth.\nNo matter how\nmystical and philosophical it sounds, it is true. Matter can neither be\ncreated, nor be destroyed. Things only change their form. When water freezes to\nbecome ice, the composition of the new hardened mass remains the same- H2O.\nShould we not grieve\nat all? What happens when we lose people we love, when relationships break?\nI think grief is\nnatural and must be allowed some time to seep in and go away. Think of grief as\nwater. It must be consumed and then, it must be eliminated from the body. If\nyou stop grief, you will be toxic. If you continue living in grief, you will be\ntoxic. Strike a balance. Anything and everything that you have lost till date\ndeserves a moment of grief. Just dont make it a lifetime of a grief-struck\nlonely heart. Move on. Matter changes form. The human body has merely been\ndestroyed for the soul to enter a new body. So many ancient cultures believe in\nrebirth. The soul is eternal and it leaves all earthly bonds behind with death.\nRead my thoughts on death and how it affected my life when I lost someone who I loved so dearly. Many more people ask about death and the feelings of guilt and grief associated with it. Will be writing a post on it soon.\nWhatever you love, you are\n\nBelieve me. What you\ntruly, deeply, passionately love is what defines you. What you do when you are\nin love defines your character more than anything else. Do you know why? Love\nis this basic, carnal, primitive emotion. It is probably the only emotion that\nmakes us so human. What would humans be without love? Where will ambition,\ndesire and even hatred reside if there is no love in our hearts.\nIf you love chocolate cakes, you may be a lover of comforts. You may be in deep need of comfort from a human that is being fulfilled by a big cake. If you love exercise, you may be in need of self-appreciation. You may want to feel better, get better self-esteem. You may love money because you love the comfort, the luxuries and even the notoriety associated with money. No dont judge me with what I am saying here. This is the truth, isnt it?\nA thousand half-loves must be foresaken to take one\nwhole heart home\n\nLove is the most\nnatural feeling known to man and yet, we are all entangled in relationships\nthat do nothing for our affections. When you look back in life, you will find\nmany half-loves, many instances where a rush of emotions made you feel like you\nare falling head over heels for someone. You will remember moments when you\nfelt like you are crushing over someone so hard that you will eventually be\nbroken into pieces.\nTruth be told. We\nare all broken into pieces. We should learn to add a premium on love.\nAnybody who appears\nattractive to the eye may not be the one you love.\nLet it last. Let it\nbrew. Let it simmer.\nLet it develop like\na perfume. Dont go barging on cheap fragrances just because they are\navailable. Wait. You may not be in love more than once in a lifetime. That love\nis the truest, deepest form of passion that your heart will feel. The others\nmay be companions, people you spend time with, people you simply want to get.\nI think we should give love some time. Dont just jump into it. Wait. You will\nbe saved from many heartbreaks and save the affection for the one who truly\ndeserves it.\nThese were my\nthoughts and musings on my 7 favorite Rumi quotes. You can perceive them\ndifferently or even like what I just said. The idea is to understand that the\nLife Makeover I am talking about isnt all about making your hair thicker and\nyour skin younger. It is also about growing mentally, emotionally and\nspiritually. I want all of us to expose us to the beauty of books and poetry,\nthe love of literature and even economics and combine all of this to grow a\nbetter person each day.\nDo these Rumi quotes make you feel romantic and long for the one you love? I have captured a few shades of love in my previous posts and poetry. Read them and let me know what you think about them.\nWhen I Said I\nLove You\nFinding\nA Convenient Love Story\nAnxious Bipolar\nLove\nLove, Love, Love\nAlone\n\n\nPosted in Musings, SpiritualTagged love poet rumi sufiLeave a comment \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Only Winter Morning I Remember\n\nPosted on March 4, 2019 by NehaJoyChauhan \n\n\nWhen winter comes knocking on my door every year, it refreshes my memory with one faint moment in my history that holds more regard for me than ever. It is not just one memory per say. It\xe2\x80\x99s more like a compound memory- invoking a few more faint, very faint memories associated with winter.\nIn a quaint little town in the foothill of Himalayas, with Eucalyptus trees, tea estates and several buildings reminiscent of the days of the British Raj, lies my memory- unhurt, unchanged by the way this place has changed over the years. It\xe2\x80\x99s a winter morning and I am walking back home. I am with the guy who was the first and only one who touched my heart in ways I could never imagine. I know it now because I never felt a connection like that before, or ever again.\nWe were similar, but so different. He-the effervescent fawn, I the quiet river. He bubbling with joy, while I\xe2\x80\xa6 I was just those silent types back in the day. Everything you could imagine in a 16-year-old with glasses on, who spends most of her time reading books and watching the Discovery Channel. We shared so many interests- reading, writing, eloquence. So much that he almost seemed like a perfect fit for me.\nAnd no\xe2\x80\xa6 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even thinking long term back in the day. We were very good friends but never anything more than that. I just felt comfortable in his presence- almost as comfortable as I was with my books.\nIt is the same road, rather small. Empty, as it used to be back in the day. The sun is shy, not quite ready to show its glorious face to the world. And an 10 am, two teens, dressed like they were stuck in an avalanche, were walking side by side. The morning was quiet, the rush and madness of the early morning hours had passed and we saw no vehicles, heard no people. All I saw around me were tall boundary walls of beautiful homes, laden with beautiful deep pink flowers.\nIt was difficult to focus on the road, difficult to focus on anything else. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t stepping on concrete, I was walking on the clouds. Happy, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know for what. I could see the flowers all around me, the trees, the houses- all in the background of my little, momentary paradise.\nI could smell someone burning leaves somewhere down the road. And I have loved the smell of those burning leaves since I was a child. I had walked down the same path with my grandfather and brother, when we were little kids and had to write an exam to enter my new school. The smell of those leaves never changes- its earthy, beautiful, almost therapeutic.\nI could hear our footsteps like I always have and I am walking fast, faster, faster than my much taller counterpart who is strolling his way with hands in his pockets and smiling. The whole world looks like a 3D painting in oil. Colors are bleeding into each other till they are no longer distinctly identifiable and suddenly time stops.\nI am walking faster, now unaware of his presence.\nSuch a small memory, emerging from the dead every year like it was yesterday. I barely remember anything about him or me or the times in which we lived together, in our complex teen years. All that I remember is that every year, when winter says hello and the mornings refuse to show me the sunshine, I remember me walking on the road by your side and it means so much to me that I have never spoken about it before. I will never speak about it again.\n Note- The post was originally published on Medium.

In my insecurity and my inability to talk about such emotional matters, I just said, I dont know. \nThe answer to the question was simple. I was always following the lead. I always felt I knew what the answer was but in the bid to be my capitalist, authoritarian, what-feelings? self, I forgot that there is a sensitive side to me that needs to be nourished and cared for, every now and then. As I said, this year is going to be a completely new experience for me. I am slowly but surely detangling emotional locks, finding the keys one at a time.\nThe biggest problem\nwith me? Love.\nThere are many\npeople around me who claim to love me. Some tell me that they have a great time\nwith me, some like the conversations. Some also liked to be bossed around by me\n(no kidding). All claim to love me. All of them. But, it never really feels like\nI am being loved. I can easily live without the company and affection of about\n80% people in my life. Sure, enjoying company is one thing. Sure, talking\nregularly is one thing. But love, is it love when you talk to someone regularly\nand enjoy their presence?\nAbsolutely not. Love\nis no more a feeling or a verb. It is just an experience that is coming too\ncheap. Why? People have started associating love with short-term affections,\nattractions and plain admiration. Remember how people tell you that they\nabsolutely LOVE your hair, your new shirt or dress? They dont LOVE it.\nThey are just using love as a superlative to like or admire. So what is\nlove in the end? What does it mean to love? Is carnal, physical, sexual or\nromantic love different than that of parental love?\nIf you ask me, I\nwill say NO. \nSo what is love?\nLove is attachment + forgiveness coupled with time.\nLooks like a simple\nequation, doesnt it? It is not and this is what you have to understand. \nAttachment\nAttachment is a\nfeeling. When two people are united to each other like nothing else. It is not\nessential for your thoughts to be my thoughts, even though it is quite\npossible. When we feel attachment, we will mostly want to be close. We will\nwant to spend as much time together as possible. We will go into the territory\nof the beloved, unhindered. We might also become obsessed with the object of\nour desire. Some people, however, react differently. They want to give\nthemselves space. They want to let themselves know that they are not fusing\ninto someone elses identity. They, hence, try to create as much distance as\npossible while never really going away. Both the conditions are all because of\nthe insecurities of the individual. I may be clingy because I am afraid you may\ngo and I may be distant because\xe2\x80\xa6 because I am afraid you may go and I will be\nhurt. \nAnd yet, we all make\nthe same mistakes, time and again. \nWhen you are in\nlove, the insecurities of the individual dissolve into the security of a\ncouple. You control each others moods, life decisions and even the heart\nbearts. It may sound like a threat to a person like me but this is what happens\nwhen you are in love. There is truly nothing wrong or cheesy about two hearts\nbecoming one- this is the ultimate truth about love. Your sweetheart is the one\nthat can lift your mood, make you feel deeply sad or just enjoy a romcom\nwithout feeling guilty for the action-thriller your missed (or vice versa). \nWhen you are around\nsomeone, all your insecurities actually go down the drain. All you are focused\non is the one you love. Now, there is no barrier, no insecurity. A hug can tell\nyou if your beloved is sad or happy or excited or how their day went. There\nwill never be a need to ask questions. A hug will say it all. I have known\nthis, I have felt this. The heart that loves you will send these small signals\nto you (science may explain this in detail, but in another post, soon) that\nwill tell you what it has felt. I felt he was bothered. I felt something was\nwrong and I shrugged it off my shoulder, thinking that I am just hallucinating.\nThinking that I may come across as nagging. I should have asked. Maybe he told\nme, maybe he could have been comforted. But then again, our actions are fueled\nby our insecurities.\nWhen you feel a deep\nsense of attachment, you will not have to talk about love. That is stupid.\nTalking about love only makes it feel like news, good today but stale tomorrow.\nLove must be felt, right till the abyss of your heart turns into a cozy bed for\nthe beloved. It must be felt till it breaks all chains, breaks barriers and\nhelps you become a soul, united with another. \nForgiveness\nWe forgive those we\nlove, often. We dont talk about how many times we have forgiven them. We dont\ntalk about why we have forgiven them. We forgive, then we forget. When you come\nhome late, you are forgiven for the endless worries that may have gone through\nwhile you were away. When you cannot make enough time for them, your are\nforgiven because they think you are genuinely busy. When you cannot fulfill\nyour promises, you are forgiven because they believe that something might have\ngenuinely demanded your time. It is not like they are not hurt. They are. They\ndont talk about it. They forgive you. Now you know why your boss never\nforgives you for being late. He hates you. LOL.\nHow many times\nduring the day do we get angry on the world and claim that everyone is a jerk\nwhile we are angels walking the earth? Today, think about how many times you\nwere forgiven by the one(s) you love for all the small discomforts and extreme\nemotional anxiety that you caused them. Think about all the times you have not\nbeen there for them when they needed you. Think about all the times when you\ndistanced yourself from them when they wanted to cry, pour their heart out to\nyou. My love lies somewhere in the corner. Waiting. A feeling, personified,\nwaiting.\nWhat happens when\nbig mistakes are committed? Of course things change then. People who love you\nwill still forgive you but they might move on too, just like you. It is\ndifficult to hold a grudge for too long. I wonder how people are able to manage\nthat kinda stuff. How long can you hate someone? Often, we do not forgive\npeople for what they have done if we do not practice self-compassion. If we\nhate ourselves, we will hate everyone and we will hold a grudge till the last\nbreath. But love, it teaches us compassion. A compassionate person forgives.\nWhere there is no forgiveness, there is no love. I have forgiven you a few\nsmall discomforts because I love you. \nThey say that when\nyou love someone, you give them the power to hurt you. What a stupid statement.\nYou think you are a saint? You hurt people too. People hurt you. It is all a\ngame where the tables keep turning. I am sorry if I ever hurt you or didnt fulfill\nyour expectations. It happens. I try my best though. I know you are trying your\nbest too. Like I said in the last post, making an effort is important but\neffort is sexy. Whatever the results, the fact that you made an effort to be by\nmy side makes all the difference to my life. \nTime\nBut I just said that\nspending time with someone or enjoying their company isnt love? Am I moving\ninto my bipolar phase again. No I am not.\xa0\n\nI remember telling\nmy best friend once- Time is the best friend of\nlove, just like you and I. A relationship that blooms slowly with time is the\nstrongest relationship in the world.\nIt was probably the\nbest words I uttered that year. Time is indeed the best friend of love, in both\nits qualitative and quantitative aspects. Qualitative, because spending time\nwith your beloved makes you closer. Qualitative, because even if you are away,\nyour heart thinks about them. \nYou know what is the\nmost intrinsic quality of love? When you fall in love, the beloved is always on\nyour mind. Even though you are physically not with them, you are spending time\nwith them in your memory. Their name catches your attention wherever you go.\nYou start associating things with them. Some place, some memory, some perfume,\nsome sight- you have already formed deep associations with the person and these\ntriggers in your mind. \nYou are spending\ntime with them even when you are not with them. Trust me, when the love is\nstrong, they feel it too. They dream of you, they think of you too. No matter\nhow metaphysical or impractical it sounds, it is true. You have to experience\nit to believe it. Yes, I am saying this because it is true. It is beyond\nreason, not because it is false but because reason isnt powerful enough to\nreach it yet. \nTime makes the\nattachment stronger. Time makes forgiveness easier to bestow upon your beloved.\nTimes makes it all worth the while. Yet, when you are with the one you love,\ntime literally stops. \nI am dropping\nanother piece of wisdom here (I have already written this on my about.me\nprofile but repeating)-\nIf you dont have to look at your watch or phone while you are with them, it is love.\nAny why shouldnt it\nbe. Time gives proof to love (just like it gives proof to matter) but time is\nvirtually non-existent when love takes over. It just isnt there. It becomes\nirrelevant. 10 minutes will feel like eternity for lovers. Sometimes they may actually\nget insecure and scared of how much time has passed (of course we sell our time\nfor money, more about this in later posts). They are usually in for a shock.\nEither more time has passed than they thought or it has just been those 10\nminutes. Damn! You lose sense of time. As love grows stronger, as bonds grow\nstronger, time slowly loses its relevance. Words are of no use. You start\ncommunicating at a different level.\nHaha! And I say this\noften while talking to my other self, love is\nall powerful, it can make you an alien. LOL. \nIt does make you an\nalien. You dont have to communicate with people through words. Sounds, smells,\ntouches do the talking. Hugging is a conversation. Kissing a heavenly dance.\nSex a cosmic ritual. You become your highest self. You are no longer human my\ndear. You are a real alien. LOL\nYou dont have to be\nwired differently to love. You just have to connect with people differently.\nIt is a pity that we are born human and die human, not the aliens I mentioned\nabove. It is a shame that we all are so capable of loving but never really love.\nIt is a shame that we are not able to love people for their souls. It is\ndisgraceful of how many times we give up on love and opportunities for true\nconnection only because of your insecurity (You can read my last post- A Child\nTrapped In An Adult Body- to read a little more about this). \nIn the end, all I\nwould like to say is that love is simply attachment and forgiveness, coupled\nwith time. \nIf it is love, it must nourish your soul. If it\ndoes anything other than this, you are in a delusion of a relationship. Get\nover it! \nBTW, the concept of\nlove can be applied to any relationship. Yes, any relationship where there is\nlove will follow this concept. Not convinced yet? Reason with yourself. Let me\nknow if your findings are any different. \nIt feels like I am\nnot my usual self this morning. The other, softer and more sensitive side has\ntaken over.

Now I wont suggest that all men are cheaters and perverts, but I am not suggesting otherwise either. Women are always pitched against each other. You will see how. \nMany men, not all- but many who I have met are looking for sympathy. No matter how much they talk about women being emotional and shit, they want their sympathy. Some even believe that women will sympathetically get into their bed.\nThe Hunt Begins\nOh look! What a poor chap he is. Life has totally run him down. Let me fuck him and cheer him up.\nThat is the only\nporn movie running in the minds of these men, over and over and over again. And let me tell you, a majority of these men- a mind boggling majority, are happily married with kids. \nThey will portray on\nthe outside that everything is right with them. They will show how much they\nlove their wife and their kids and their family. A woman will find him\nharmless. \nhmm.. He is happily married. He is not hitting on me. He is totally harmless., she thinks. \nSo she feels somewhat secure with him. This man shows compassion and presents himself as a great figure to look up to. Damn, if only your husband or boyfriend or future boyfriend or future husband was like that. \nWomen have their guards down with these men. They know that he will not make inappropriate jokes with her, he will be a true gentleman and so on and so forth. \nWhat an exemplary man!\nChivalry is not dead!\nI will tell you something. It is dead indeed. \nThe Next Step\nSo when this man finds out that you have your guard down and you don\xe2\x80\x99t see him as a threat, he slowly opens up to you. You have no idea of how perverted this man is. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know his phone is filled with pornography and he shares them on groups with at least 50 other men. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know the kind of super perverted jokes he shares. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about his woman. I bet even his wife doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know a lot about him. \nSuperheroes may have double lives, but so do super villains, right? After all, having an affair could be quite a nice way to kill time on the side. \nSlowly, this man will make a plan. He will try to be his sweet, gentlemanly self and try to woo you with his chivalrous charm. Then slowly, he will try to show you that his life is not as perfect as it seems. \nA comprehensive guide to what married men always say\nIt is a loveless, sexless marriage. All she is busy with is the kids. I have bills to pay. I have a family to keep. How will I do all this alone? I wish she was more supportive and understood my EMOTIONAL needs.\nIt was an arranged marriage. She is a nice woman you know. She is a very good wife but not quite the woman I wanted her to be. I wanted to spend my life with any intelligent, smart woman who was more than just a wife. You know\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\xa6 I wish I met you before.\nI love her. I truly love her. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t like a few things about her. She\xe2\x80\xa6 she is just _________ (add some made up shit here). \nShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand me.\nI wish she understood me like you do.\nSometimes, I feel like I want to break free and live my life for a moment.\nI am going through so much. It is so difficult to keep a straight face but I try really hard.\nFor people, I am just a happily married guy. No one knows what is going on inside. \nI have never opened up to anyone like I have opened up to you. It is like I am letting go of my emotional bondage. You have set me free.\nWe share a deep bond. We cant really label this relationship that we share. It is just different. It is beautiful and I wish it remains this way forever.\nWe just live in the same house. We don\xe2\x80\x99t even talk to each other.\nYou know. I have wanted a divorce on a number of occassions. But then I thought I will wreck my household and that will have a great impact on my children. My parents, her parents, our families- they all will be shattered. So I wait for things to get better. I just manage with whatever I have.\nYada! Yada! Yada!\nWhatever!\nAnd you are falling\nListening to all this could make you feel special. You feel a kind of sympathy for him. You feel that he is going through so much and still being strong. You feel that he deserves something good. You admire that he can open up to you. What do women want? They want someone who can talk to them. \nThis guy talks to you. I swear if he had any problems and if he talked like that to his wife, she would have certainly listened and solved those problems. He shouldnt be telling you what is wrong. \nAll the while he\npretends to be a strong guy with a soft interior. He will tell you that he has\nfeelings too. He will also tell you that he has bottled up his feelings for too\nlong and now he cannot contain them any longer. \nThen, when you are fully prepped, he will take you.\nTalking is the best foreplay for women, I swear. \nHe has talked\nenough. Now all he craves for is a hug. \nThen he\ninstinctively leans on to kiss (or so you think).\nThat is the moment.\nYou have lost. He has won. \nAfter he is done, he\nwill put up the same face of the gentleman. \nA real gentleman\nwill never cheat on his wife. \nYou have been duped. He will probably do that again. With you and other women maybe. All the while he will make you believe that he is a happily married person who wont ever cheat on his wife. He will also make you believe that what you share with him is something divine. Yeah! Sure!\nThe trouble with the wife\nAnd then there are\nthe wives. \nOh my god! There is a reason you will constantly be duped by the husband. See, the other woman that you think stole your husband, was also duped by him. \nBut I know what you\nwill do. \nYou will think that\nthis other woman stole your man away from you. \nDamn it! Damn it! Damn HIM and damn YOU!\nIf the wife and the\nother woman are both fools, the wife who thinks her man has been stolen is the\nbigger fool. You know why? Because you are in denial. \nTell me. \nIs your husband a\ntoy?\nIs your husband a limited edition antique dick on an auction?\nIs your husband a\nchild who was lured by her?\nTell me what do you think?\nHow can someone steal your husband away from you if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want it to happen? Worst so, how can she be allowed in his life romantically or sexually if he is not opening up to her or, in most scenarios, guiding her there. Leading her on.  \nHow can someone\nsteal your husband away from you if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want it to happen? Worst so, how\ncan she be allowed in his life romantically or sexually if he is not opening up\nto her or, in most scenario, guiding her there. Leading her on. \nSex is not as\nsacred. Seriously.

Maybe there\nare men in your office, in your neighborhood and in your friend circle who\nwould want to get it on with you. \nBut, you don\xe2\x80\x99t go. \nIt is your conscious\ndecision to stay loyal to your partner. \nWhy cant your\nhusband take this decision?\nWhy cant somebody\nsteal you away from him?\nAny answer?\nThe answer is simple and very clear. When you are in a relationship, you commit to each other. You vow in front of the world to stay loyal to each other. If you have the chance of staying loyal (let me also point out that women, on an average will find sex more conveniently than men), why cant he?\nNow you will ask\nquestions.\nOh she is a homewrecker.\nBut she knew he was married. Why did she sleep with him.\nShe wanted to steal my husband away. She should have known her boundaries.\nI know these filthy sluts. They just want to sleep their way to the top. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have any morals or shame.\nOh yeah! She should have known her boundaries.  TRUE. \nShe should have taught your husband some morals and shame too when he was shamelessly painting you as an inefficient wife. TRUE.\nShe should have been smart enough to understand that married men who approach her are merely interested in gaining sympathy and.. And her body. TRUE.\nUnderstood. Fine. You are right here. Women can be such fools when it comes to love. Like her and YOU. \nBut you know who\nexactly stepped out of the marital boundaries? Your husband or the other woman?\nWho is responsible\nto stay loyal to you and love you? Your husband or the other woman?\nWho broke\npromises?\xa0 Your husband or the other\nwoman?\nAnd finally, who\nwill stick to his sorry ass for a lifetime? You or the other woman?\nHe has done it once\nand he will do it again. \nHe will do it\nbecause you were in denial. \nAffairs don\xe2\x80\x99t just happen. They are made to happen. Women are wooed, charmed and made to believe that the man who is after her is somewhat divine. They are lied to. They are kept in a dungeon where she is bonded, but she always finds a garden of roses on the outside. This makes her womanly heart happy. She is happy that there are roses in the garden. She thinks it is HER garden and then she wants to protect it like a fierce lioness- NEVER understanding that the male is toying around behind her back. And this happens to both you women- the wife and the other woman/side chick. \nAnd no. This doesnt\nhappen to the other woman alone. This is happening to you as well.\nYou, the wife. \nYou are both women. You both have your own soft corners. You both have your own sensibilities. You both are emotional and these emotions are often used against you, to make you fall. \nI am sure that the\npercentage of real home wreckers and husband stealers is really less in the\nworld, if they are present at all. \nMost women  wives,\ngirlfriends or other women, are just that, they are women. \nAnd then there is a\nman who thinks he can conquer it all. \nYou know who is at\nfault now?\nYou see who is the\nculprit?\nThe other woman may\nleave him. Of course, you will try your best to screw her emotionally,\nfinancially and more. She will be broken and she will leave. \nWhat about you? \nWhat are you left with? What did you fight for?\nIs it worth fighting for?\n\n\nPosted in MusingsTagged cheater cheating cheating menLeave a comment \n\n\nPosts navigation\n\n Older posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Posts\n\n\nPigeons And Metros\n\n\nLose Some Weight Woman!
