I am also an Economic Research Forum (ERF) Research Fellow, and currently serve as its Thematic Co-Leader for the macroeconomics theme. I have recently joined Rebuilding Macroeconomics (a research initiative funded by the Economic and Social Research Council) as a Co-Leader for the Sustainable Growth\xa0Hub. My main areas of research are macroeconomics, global and national macroeconometric modelling, Middle East economics, energy economics, and climate change. My research has been published in edited volumes and leading journals, and has been covered in major international news outlets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
