Normally I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even mention it, but\xe2\x80\xa6 things are getting weirder almost daily and many people are starting to freak out. I want to put this out there JUST to compare notes with others and see what others may have heard about this and related topics. To be clear, the subject of this story is not ACTUAL martial law in the U.S., but the apparent urgency and immediacy of some peoples\xe2\x80\x99 expectations about it and their reported near-term consequent actions.SUPPOSEDLY, a local (Southern Oregon) family with friends in law enforcement (who may or may not have tipped them off re: government planning) is gathering up their guns, ammo and camping gear and heading off \xe2\x80\x9cinto the woods\xe2\x80\x9d this weekend with an unknown number of other like-minded people to stay for an indefinite period of time. Their expectation is that we are on the verge of martial law in the U.S. with widespread curfew, travel lock-downs, more store shut-downs and, possibly, worse scheduled to begin on or about Monday, March 23, 2020. \xe2\x80\xa6Read more  \xc2\xb7 3 min read1 Mar 14Join the Corona General Strike!The Corona virus pandemic is a crisis and, in every crisis, there is opportunity. As we speak, corporations are planning to ramp up home foreclosures, auto repossessions and bank late payment fees in true disaster-capitalist style. They will do their best to find ways to take advantage of the pandemic and resulting economic slow-down to pad their bottom lines at our expense [1]. Because they can.But, what if \xe2\x80\x9cwe the people\xe2\x80\x9d choose to take advantage of this crisis to push for the policy changes we need to make our lives more secure, prosperous and healthy? \xe2\x80\xa6Read more  \xc2\xb7 3 min readMar 5I am Done with Squandering My Resistance for a Pocketful of Mumbles.

That\xe2\x80\x99s bound to trigger some to try to spread false and misleading narratives about him and his candidacy. Such false narratives often \xe2\x80\x9ctravel halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on\xe2\x80\x9d. This FAFN sheet is intended to be a ready pair of 7-league boots to help us all kick back hard against the onslaught of falsehoods about Sanders. Check back for updates.Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is almost entirely about leveling our society\xe2\x80\x99s playing field so that people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t in the highest income brackets can enjoy equal access to health care and education. Society as a whole, does better when everyone has an opportunity to achieve their full potential and contribute their best potential abilities to our economy. Everyone does better when everyone does better.Unfortunately we\xe2\x80\x99ve drifted away from that ideal over the past few decades and public policies have now been molded to favor the wealthy with low taxes and, often, subsidies for economic activities that have many negative side effects. Thus, wealthy special interests stand to lose a lot if Bernie becomes president and their attacks, through corporate media, are predictable. Their goal is, as with many public relations campaigns, to create \xe2\x80\x9cfear, uncertainty and doubt\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cFUD\xe2\x80\x9d) about Senator Sanders and either convince people to vote for someone else or not to vote at all. \xe2\x80\xa6Read more  \xc2\xb7 12 min readFeb 20Five Days in Reno \xe2\x80\x94 Driving Senior and Disabled Voters to Early Voting in Nevada\xe2\x80\x99s 2020 PrimaryA journey of a thousand miles begins with a hybrid.The manufactured home was just one of thousands of random-looking boxes scattered across the high desert as if blown there by the Washoe winds Mark Twain wrote of in \xe2\x80\x9cRoughing It\xe2\x80\x9d.

Bush Pants-on-Fire-Mobile \xe2\x80\x94 a rolling tribute to the then-remarkable torrent of lies extruding from the oval orifices. I was awarded the honor of driving it from Eugene to Reno by virtue of simply having volunteered to do so online. Circa 2004.In October of ought-four, Ben Cohen organized a national tour for his George W. Bush Pants-on-Fire-Mobile. The \xe2\x80\x9crig\xe2\x80\x9d consisted of a comfy Crown Vic sedan and a flat bed trailer with a 10 foot tall statue of lyin\xe2\x80\x99 George W. Bush. The pants-flames were simulated with orange triangular flags of nylon flapping in the breeze of an on-board blower powered by a gas generator that also powered an LED scroll-board enumerating many dozens of lies from the Dubya\xe2\x80\x99s first term in office. At that time the sheer number of lies was unquestionably a Presidential all-time record.Ah, the good-old-days.Ben sent out an e-mail to some e-mail group I subscribed to asking for drivers. I volunteered and, without anything resembling a background check that I can recall (was I well-versed in Presidential lying? Did I have a healthy disapproval of the current POTUS? Have you ever been arrested for littering or had to sit on the Group-W bench? It seemed to be enough that I had a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license and spare time) I was awarded the Eugene-to-Reno leg of the trip.
