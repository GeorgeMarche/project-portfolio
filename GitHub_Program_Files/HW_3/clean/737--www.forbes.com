It encapsulates both the immediate orbit of the 45th president of the United States, as well as all his idiosyncrasies. Like the way he treats facts and perception as fungible concepts, something that\xe2\x80\x99s allowed him to build a reality TV presidency upon a ramshackle foundation in which the truth is never literal or absolute.\nFour years in, everybody knows the game by now. For the members of the Fourth Estate who cover it, however, its rules and norms are arguably as murky as they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been.\nMaking your bones as a journalist has always been a lot harder than it looks, especially to anyone with an idealized notion of newsmen and women as mere truth-seekers scrambling to capture the first rough draft of history. You can say what you want about the presidency of Donald J. Trump, but one thing it\xe2\x80\x99s done remarkably well is shine a big, bright light on some of the inadequacies of the reporting profession \xe2\x80\x94 like the way too many journalists still regard the truth as whatever insight happens to be Frankensteined together once you\xe2\x80\x99ve sufficiently captured \xe2\x80\x9cboth sides\xe2\x80\x9d of a story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump takes questions from reporters on his way to Marine One on the South Lawn of the ...

Consider, for example, a recent campaign dispatch from The Associated Press, which begins straightforward enough: \xe2\x80\x9cOn the campaign trail with President Donald Trump, the pandemic is largely over, the economy is roaring back, and murderous mobs are infiltrating America\xe2\x80\x99s suburbs.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Democrat Joe Biden, the pandemic is raging, the economy isn\xe2\x80\x99t lifting the working class, and systemic racism threatens Black lives across America.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhat the GOP incumbent and Democratic challenger each present to voters, the AP writer continues, are \xe2\x80\x9cdizzyingly different\xe2\x80\x9d versions of reality. Because there\xe2\x80\x99s more than one, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you know? As if that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough, the writer continues: \xe2\x80\x9cAll the conflicting messages carry at least a sliver of truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWelcome to Election Day 2020, folks: Trump and Biden may be the names on the ballot, but I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s really just one sliver of truth that\xe2\x80\x99s fighting another.\nThe question we have to ask ourselves, especially after having read a piece like that, is whether modern journalism is sufficient to cover a president who\xe2\x80\x99s told aides in the past that they should consider each day of the administration to be the equivalent of a TV episode. That was, in fact, an actual marching order that Trump handed down not long after settling into the Oval Office, and it implies the presence of an antagonist, a hero, and an overarching plot that must be resolved by the time the credits roll. Knowing that, you can\xe2\x80\x99t help but ask the question \xe2\x80\x94 is it time for journalists to scrap the current way of approaching the grind, which calls for being a dispassionate bearer of witness who dutifully records the events of the day, in favor of ... well, something else?\xa0\nFormer CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather has been thinking about these questions for decades, and still is. I caught up with him recently to have a conversation about our shared profession \xe2\x80\x94 and, especially, what he thinks needs to change about it in the age of Trump.\xa0\nRather has certainly enjoyed a career that\xe2\x80\x99s already spanned epochal change, from back in the days when anchors with grave oration read the news to millions of Americans who sat in front of TV sets by the millions in what was then a shared, communal experience. It was back before all of us were tethered to the digital grid, before the modern era when news moves at the speed of a tweet and a journalist like Rather is as old-school as it gets.\nOne of the things I wanted to ask the 88-year-old reporter \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s how he still thinks of himself; just a reporter, forget all the other acclaim \xe2\x80\x94 is what he would be doing right now if he were still in the anchor chair with an audience of millions. Funny thing about that: He kind of still is, just in a different way. He maintains a feisty and news-heavy Twitter and Facebook presence, which gives him a combined digital audience of millions. And when he\xe2\x80\x99s not using social media to share his analysis of the news of the day, he\xe2\x80\x99s reading most of the major newspapers like The New York Times\n\nNYT\n. He stays glued to outlets like CNN online \xe2\x80\x94 basically, he still lives and breathes the gig. Never mind that he\xe2\x80\x99s, as he wistfully describes it, on the \xe2\x80\x9cback side of the mountain\xe2\x80\x9d now.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the end, what\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of journalism?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked me during our chat. \xe2\x80\x9cThe purpose is to be an honest broker of information. To get to the truth or as close to the truth as is humanly possible. And to tell it.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in a situation now that\xe2\x80\x99s totally different than anything we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever faced as a country, as a nation, as a society, as a people \xe2\x80\x94 particularly for journalists. I still frequently question myself, and I think this is genuinely true of anybody trying to be a journalist with any integrity these days \xe2\x80\xa6 Journalism is not an exact science. On its best days, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a crude art \xe2\x80\x94 which is to say, of course we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make mistakes. Sometimes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make bigger mistakes than others. Nobody can do it perfectly. You need to say that to yourself as well as people that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to serve.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat AP campaign story, which equates two diametrically opposed messages as simply different versions of reality, is Exhibit A for what Rather says journalists absolutely, cannot do right now. Journalists, he says, cannot treat the Trump presidency as a normal thing, and cover it the same way as adminstrations that came before.\xa0\nI caught up with Rather the day after President Trump relocated from the White House to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as a result of his COVID-19 diagnosis \xe2\x80\x94 and two days before Trump bizarrely decided to just walk out of the hospital, return to the White House and dramatically take off his face mask in front of a baffled press corps. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump gives a thumbs-up as he leaves Walter Reed Medical Center to return to the White ... [+] House.\n\nAFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo try to treat President Trump as \xe2\x80\x98normal\xe2\x80\x99 runs the risk of stretching ourselves into contortionists trying to be fair,\xe2\x80\x9d Rather said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd all of this, we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned the hard way, helps him lie, helps him cheat, helps him divide.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be an honest broker of information with Donald Trump, you just \xe2\x80\x94 you can\xe2\x80\x99t fall into the trap of applying what used to be normal guideposts for journalists. As an American, you always want to give a president, particularly a new president, the benefit of the doubt. But in President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s case, the lies and attacks on fundamental institutions of the country \xe2\x80\x94 including the press \xe2\x80\x94 came right from the beginning. Lies about illegal voting, lies about the size of the inauguration crowd, all of that. President Trump spat on the norms of democracy, and \xe2\x80\x94 this is important \xe2\x80\x94 he demanded that journalists reframe the outrages he was perpetrating through the normal lenses of political coverage, to use that to his advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhich forces journalists into an awkward position, Rather continued, of pursuing an unsatisfying \xe2\x80\x9cboth sides-ism,\xe2\x80\x9d where \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take a side, so therefore by not taking a side, you took a side.\xe2\x80\x9d Barring that, some journalists have decided that actually going full-bore into the arena of activism and activist journalism is the only correct way to cover the Trump administration.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen my feet hit the floor in the morning, the first thing I still ask myself is where is the story, where\xe2\x80\x99s the big story, and how can I get on it?\xe2\x80\x9d Rather told me. \xe2\x80\x9cA rule of thumb that worked for me over the years is to just let your journalistic conscience be your guide. Recognize you can\xe2\x80\x99t do it perfectly. Recognize that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make mistakes. Say to yourself, I\xe2\x80\x99m just out here everyday doing the best I can. And I need to commit myself to that and hope that the rest takes care of itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSpeaking to this specific moment that we find ourselves in, Rather continues: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very perilous, very dangerous time for our country. There\xe2\x80\x99s no getting around that. It\xe2\x80\x99s historically been strong in the American character, a sense of ... steadiness. Just, steady. We as a country and as a people, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through a hell of a lot. But I\xe2\x80\x99m an optimist by nature and by experience. And I recommend when you can, be as heavy into hopefulness as you can be. And optimism. But not kind of wooly-headed, like, well, everything\xe2\x80\x99s going to just be alright.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do think we can come through this period and come out the other end and eventually be better for it, but only if we get busy. It won\xe2\x80\x99t just happen by wishing it. It never has. So my word is, stay steady. Stay stalwart. Be as optimistic as you can. And work like hell. And if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking yourself what you can do, if you want to help your country and help your community get through this time, maybe say to yourself \xe2\x80\x94 what can I do today to help someone else? And just start from there.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFollow me on\xa0Twitter.\xa0Andy MeekI\xe2\x80\x99m a writer who lives in Memphis and who\xe2\x80\x99s covered media, in various forms and formats, for almost 20 years.
