It\'s been at the root of some of the most vicious inhumanity in all of history. A malignant narcissist when threatened makes decisions impulsively and walks a line between sanity and insanity. We are now witnessing that descent in plain view.\nThe Producers\n\n\n\n\nThose who offer such advice he perceives as contrary will increasingly be seen as actively subverting his best interests, as he understands them. He\'ll grow more defiant, more reckless, more anti-constitutional, and more dangerous.\nDavid Frum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\'s bad and getting worse\nDonald Trump is a Malignant Narcissist.\n\n\nMalignant Narcissism is a syndrome, with 4 components:\n\nNarcissistic personality disorder\nAnti-social behavior (sociopathy)\nParanoia\nSadism\n\nThe malignant narcissist is grandiose, with an inflated sense of accomplishment, and an excessive need for admiration. He is boastful, hypersensitive to criticism, arrogant, and envious. He is always ready to raise hostility levels, and uses deceit and manipulation. He transgresses social norms, and lacks moral conscience. He is preoccupied with perceived disloyalty, bearing grudges, quick to blame others, and prone to conspiracy theories. He is dehumanizing to people he perceives as weak,\xa0capable\xa0of\xa0taking\xa0 glee\xa0in\xa0their\xa0misfortune.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#UNFIT is NOT politically motivated; it does not advocate for policy issues or take a stance on matters of state. The film is also NOT intended to offer a formal diagnosis nor recommend treatment. This film speaks only to the collective welfare of Americans, and the world.
