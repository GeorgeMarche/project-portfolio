Being careless or selfish not only can cause deaths from the virus itself but causing Mental Health issues from various situations caused by having to take measures strange to what we are used to in normal everyday life.\n\n\n\n\n\n Covid_19 UK\n\n\n\tPosted on 30 September 2020 | \n\tBy oinfo.uk \n\nits now September 2020 and its about 8 Months since it came to the UK !!!\nHere is a Month by Month timeline of this Pandemic\nR number and the rise in Covid-19 cases 29 September\nNHS Social distancing: what you need to do\n\n\n\n\n\n Mask Wearing in shops\n\n\n\tPosted on 14 July 2020 | \n\tBy oinfo.uk \n\nMaybe after all this time the Government will understand we all need to wear a mask in public because this Covid19 is partly aerosoled and we cant see it. So to help protect each other and save lives. Wear a mask in shops has been announced\n\n\n\n\n\n Masks and lack of Oxygen\n\n\n\tPosted on 11 July 2020 | \n\tBy oinfo.uk \n\n Quite a few people saying adverse things about wearing masks, quite probably because they are feeling claustrophobic or just dont like wearing one because its not the normal thing to do for them? But lets remember we all have a duty of care towards our fellow Humans and spreading Covid19 knowing you could be asymptomatioc and spreading it with the possibility of it killing someone is that how you like to be!? So, is it true that when wearing a mask it starves you of Oxygen? well the answer is apparently No it doesnt according to this HC Professional.and many others because if it did do you REALLY think they would be wearing then ALL DAYphotos she posted on her Facebook Page.\n\n\n\nMore on this story here.\n\n\n\n\n Face Mask wearing?\n\n\n\tPosted on 11 July 2020 | \n\tBy oinfo.uk \n\nFirstly I am no Doctor or Health Advisor but my experience in life and at work along with LOTS of research I am doing this to try and help people. Finally after eight months or so of Coronavirus pandemic, Covid19 as its been known as since February 23rd 2020 when The World Health Organisation named it so we wouldnt get mixed up between Covid10 and othewr Coronaviruses like Seasonal Flu it might be the UK Government will be anopuncing that Mask wearing in shops might become compulsory? BBC link here\n\nMore news on the wearing of masks from Newspapers etc below.\nWired Co UK on 29th June 2020 Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t face coverings compulsory in the UK?\nDaily Mail 11 July 2020 Masks WILL become compulsory in shops and pubs within weeks as Boris Johnson wears a mask for the first time to pull a pints\nIf you are wanting to buy a mask there are plenty of non-surgical masks on eBay,co.uk There are the best ones like Vogmask and Cambridge Mask and expect to pay around \xc2\xa3100 or so currently for these as they are better than most others because they have been made with the best filters and materials, the filter being the full size of the mask so you get better filtration than the ones that have a filter you can take out and renew because these type only filter part of the mask. Vogmask and Cambridge Masks are reuseable for quite some time depending on how often used Vogmask say 3 tyo 5 months depending and Cambridge Mask say 340 hrs depending.\nLook for N95 or best N99 but try not to buy the ones that Healthcare workers use. Make sure your hands are cleaned before putting a mask on and DONT touch the mask itself when in use and taking it off as it will have Covid19 on it and it will be spread everywhere you touch so be careful. Wear your mask over your Mouth and Nose properly and it will HELP to protect you and others.\nOther places to look are Gumtree, Preloved and Etsy but be careful what and who you buy from as always. #Wearamasktosavelives #lookaftereachother\n\n\n\nVogmask (below) has Earloops and a vent they come in different designs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Coronavirus\n\n\n\tPosted on 29 June 2020 | \n\tBy oinfo.uk \n\nCoronavirus Why is it called Covid_19?\nMost Media and Authorities are STILL calling this latest Novel Coronavirus Pandemic Coronavirus and not as they should be calling it Covid_19 even after more than 4 Months!

Tens of thousands of people have been infected.\nDr Ghebreyesus called on the world to fight the new virus as aggressively as possible.\nThe word coronavirus refers to the group of viruses it belongs to, rather than the latest strain.\nThe virus itself\xa0has been designated SARS-CoV-2\xa0by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.\nResearchers have been calling for an official name to avoid confusion and stigmatisation of any group or country because its not only Covid_19 it is Coronavirus Seasonal Flu plus others\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Clap for Carers\n\n\n\tPosted on 28 May 2020 | \n\tBy oinfo.uk \n\nIts been said that this Thursday 28th May 2020 Clap for Carers might be the last one, but some people think it should carry on to give the Front Line workers support as its still needed it was started 10 weeks ago by Annemarie Plas and heres the Website and you can follow her on Twitter @AnnemariePlas\nIt is said that some of the Front Line workers in the NHS and Care sectors that they will be suffering Mental Trauma themselves so in my opinion we NEED to still help them and will have to for some time to come?\nFacebook Video about Annemarie Plas and the last Clap?\nYoga with Annemarie Plas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Coronavirus Covid_19\n\n\n\tPosted on 7 May 2020 | \n\tBy oinfo.uk \n\nCoronavirus is a group of Viruses and this latest Novel Coronavirus was named Covid_19 on Feruary 11th 2020 so as to differentiate between this latest Covid_19 Pandemic and SARS, MERS and Seasonal Flu BECAUSE there are some differences.\n\n\n\n\n UK General Election 2019\n\n\n\tPosted on 14 December 2019 | \n\tBy oinfo.uk \n\nThe UK General Election was held on Thursday 12 December 2019. \nIt was a Landslide Victory for the Conservatives with Boris Johnson at the Helm votes received  13,966,565 total seats  365, he had a Slogan Get Brexit Done which seemed to catch on quite a bit.\nJo Swinson came out worse than most and even lost her seat Lib-Dems got just 11 seats with  3,696,423 votes.
