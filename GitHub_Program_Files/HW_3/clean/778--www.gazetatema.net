Really good. I think perfect, Trump said during a telephone interview with Fox Business, his first since he was released from a three-day hospital stay on Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99m better to the point where I\xe2\x80\x99d love to do a rally tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said. He added, \xe2\x80\x9cI dont think Im contagious at all.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says individuals can discontinue isolation 10 days after the onset of symptoms, which for Trump was October 1, according to his doctors. Conley said that meant Trump, who has been surrounded by minimal staffing as he works out of the White House residence and the Oval Office, could return to holding events on Saturday.\nHe added that Trump was showing no evidence of his illness progressing or adverse reactions to the aggressive course of therapy prescribed by his doctors.\nEarlier this week, the president\xe2\x80\x99s doctors suggested they would work closely with military medical research facilities and other laboratories on \xe2\x80\x9cadvanced diagnostic testing\xe2\x80\x9d to determine when the president was no longer contagious, but did not elaborate.\nDr Anthony Fauci, the government\xe2\x80\x99s top infectious disease expert, said two negative PCR lab tests 24 hours apart are a key factor in determining whether someone is still contagious.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, if the president goes 10 days without symptoms, and they do the tests that we were talking about, then you could make the assumption, based on good science, that he is not infected,\xe2\x80\x9d Fauci said on MSNBC on Thursday.\nWhile reports of reinfection are rare, the CDC recommends that even people who recover from COVID-19 continue to wear a mask, stay distanced and follow other precautions. It was unclear if Trump, who eschewed mask-wearing in most settings, would abide by that guidance.\nThe White House, meanwhile, continued to decline to share when Trump last tested negative for the virus \xe2\x80\x94 which would help pinpoint when he was infected. Strategic communications director Alyssa Farah said that information was Trumps \xe2\x80\x9cprivate medical history.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOver the objections of some aides, Trump returned to the Oval Office on Thursday, even though a workspace had been set up in the residential section of the White House. Only a few senior aides, medical staff and security personnel have laid eyes on the president since he returned to the White House on Monday afternoon.\nTrump also released a video on Thursday morning, filmed a day earlier, directly addressing the nations seniors \xe2\x80\x94 a critical demographic for his campaign that is also at greatest risk of poor outcomes from the virus \xe2\x80\x94 saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to get the same care that I got.\nOn Thursday, Trump continued to credit an experimental drug for the seemingly quick pace of his recovery. He called his diagnosis a \xe2\x80\x9cblessing in disguise\xe2\x80\x9d in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s battle against the pandemic.\nSeemingly sensitive to the fact that his treatment course has been far more comprehensive than the care received by average Americans, he promised to swiftly get the drug approved for broader use \xe2\x80\x94 and distribute it for free \xe2\x80\x94 even though he does not have the power to order that himself.\nTrump received an experimental antibody drug made by Regeneron through a \xe2\x80\x9ccompassionate use\xe2\x80\x9d exemption, a recognition of the above-and-beyond standard of care he receives as president. The safety and effectiveness of the drug have not yet been proven. And there is no way for the president or his doctors to know that the drug had any effect. Most people recover from COVID-19.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had tremendous luck with this Regeneron,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said during the interview.\nDr Sean Conley, the White House physician, said in a memo on Wednesday that Trump had been symptom-free for over 24 hours, and that his oxygen saturation level and respiratory rate were normal.\nTrump speculated that he caught the virus either at the September 26 Rose Garden event announcing his new Supreme Court nominee or at a meeting with military families the following day. He said family members often want to get up close to him and \xe2\x80\x9ckiss\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chug\xe2\x80\x9d him.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x99Back up. Stand 10 feet\xe2\x80\x9d away, Trump said.
