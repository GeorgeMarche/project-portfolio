Phil Murphy said Thursday his predecessor is "the quintessential Jersey fighter.\xe2\x80\x9dChristie\xe2\x80\x99s exact condition remains unknown and it\xe2\x80\x99s still unclear what course of treatment he\xe2\x80\x99s receiving. The 58-year-old hasn\xe2\x80\x99t tweeted since Saturday, and doctors, family, and friends have not made any public announcements about how he\xe2\x80\x99s doing.But a source familiar with the situation told NJ Advance Media on Wednesday that Christie was in good spirits, getting good care, and is not on a ventilator.Multiple sources said there were no changes as of Thursday afternoon.Murphy, a Democrat who succeeded Republican Christie in 2018, said he \xe2\x80\x9cexchanged notes\xe2\x80\x9d with Christie on Wednesday night but has \xe2\x80\x9cno further insight\xe2\x80\x9d into his condition.\xe2\x80\x9cI shot him a note, as I had done a couple of days earlier, just to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re here for him,\xe2\x80\x9d Murphy said during his latest coronavirus briefing in Trenton. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was very gracious in his reply. And he remains in our prayers.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a fighter, let there be no doubt about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Murphy added. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the quintessential Jersey fighter. We\xe2\x80\x99re all with him in thoughts, prayers, and we\xe2\x80\x99re here to do whatever we can for him.\xe2\x80\x9dChristie\xe2\x80\x99s stay is currently slightly longer than an average COVID-19 hospitalization. Five days is the median length of hospital stays for coronavirus patients outside of China, according to an analysis of 52 studies published last month in BMC Medicine.Christie announced Saturday morning he tested positive for the the coronavirus \xe2\x80\x94 a day after President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump announced they had tested positive.

Christie \xe2\x80\x94 a longtime Trump friend and ally and fellow Republican \xe2\x80\x94 also attended the now-infamous Rose Garden ceremony where Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court.At least 10 others at the Rose Garden event on Sept. 26 have since tested positive, including New Jersey native Kellyanne Conway, a former adviser to the president. Masks and social distancing were largely ignored at the ceremony, now feared to be a super-spreader event.Bill Stepien, Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign manager an another New Jersey native, has also tested positive.Trump announced he tested positive early Friday night and was taken to Walter Reed Medical Center in Maryland later that afternoon. He returned to the White House on Monday evening after three days in the hospital and released a video saying he feels better than he has in 20 years and warning people not to let the virus \xe2\x80\x9cdominate your lives.\xe2\x80\x9dThe U.S. has suffered more than 211,000 coronavirus deaths since the outbreak began earlier this year.
