The district would not confirm how many of the cases were student athletes.\xc2\xa0The Scottsdale Unified School District announced last week that a\xc2\xa0member of Chaparral High School\'s varsity football team had\xc2\xa0tested positive and that the school\'s first two junior varsity and varsity football games would be canceled as players quarantined for 14 days. The district\'s superintendent later\xc2\xa0clarified to The Arizona Republic that two athletes had tested positive.WEEK 2:\xc2\xa0At least 4 Arizona high school football teams canceling Week 2 games because of COVID-19After the games were canceled, a Facebook page called \xe2\x80\x9cParents in Support of 2020 Football in Arizona" has been picking up steam\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0currently has more than\xc2\xa01,400 members.Brad Schweigert, a Cave Creek resident and father of a quarterback at Notre Dame Prep, posted in the group last week, calling on parents to "manage\xc2\xa0COVID-19 testing ourselves" and keep the test\xc2\xa0results private."If the results are positive, then keep him away from the team and tell your coaches he needs a couple weeks off for \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d reasons," Schweigert wrote.Schweigert said in his post that they\'d\xc2\xa0"worked\xc2\xa0out a deal" with 360Care, a testing provider,\xc2\xa0to test football families at discounted rates, and that the tests would not be reported to the county."I do think we must take control of this issue and manage it ourselves as a parent group," he wrote. "We have already seen the results on how this will be managed for us if we leave it up to county health and school officials."Schweigert\xc2\xa0said he floated the idea as a safer option.\xc2\xa0"I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen several people already suggest that no players should get tested for the rest of the season. The way I see it, the plan we have laid out is a much safer and more responsible alternative," he said in the post.\xc2\xa0Schweigert\'s post said 360Care had given football families a code to use for $10 off a test, and that results would not be reported to the county.Tara Thompson,\xc2\xa0the owner of 360Care,\xc2\xa0told The Republic the tests in question assess the antibody response of patients\xc2\xa0and don\'t have to be reported to the county like traditional\xc2\xa0diagnostic tests that are taken through nasal swabs or saliva.\xc2\xa0But any company that acts as a lab and is using\xc2\xa0COVID-19 tests approved by the FDA\xc2\xa0is required to report test results to the Arizona Department of Health Services, according to a health department spokesperson.What reporting is required under law?360Care\xc2\xa0advertises rapid COVID-19 testing for $75 with "results in 5 minutes" on its website.Thompson, a physician\'s assistant,\xc2\xa0said she began offering COVID-19 testing when she noticed a need in her neighborhood and local community. Thompson said she currently partners with BioLab Sciences,a Scottsdale company,\xc2\xa0to use FDA-approved tests to provide "concierge COVID" services straight to people\'s homes.The testing administered by 360Care\xc2\xa0uses a fingerprick of blood to detect if someone has produced an immune response to fight off the virus, according to Thompson. She said these tests are considered presumptive testing and not reported.\xc2\xa0Thompson said individuals who test positive on the presumptive testing also receive a traditional diagnostic COVID-19 swab or saliva test, which she said is reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But an ADHS spokesperson said that all COVID-19 lab results are required to be reported to the state\xc2\xa0under\xc2\xa0the Arizona Administrative Code and Enhanced Surveillance Advisories established by Executive Order.\xc2\xa0\'Absolutely unacceptable\'David Hines, the executive director of the Arizona Interscholastic Association (AIA), the state\'s largest high school sports association, called the suggestion of hiding tests \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely unacceptable.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cThe bottom line is we want to protect kids,\xe2\x80\x9d Hines said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have been given an opportunity to play. Everyone has to follow the procedures. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the fans, the players and the coaches, there are protocols to help reduce the chances of people getting it."Scottsdale Superintendent Scott Menzel\xc2\xa0said that parents are required to report their children\'s positive diagnoses under a commitment to the district that each parent signed."If we can\'t trust that our parents are partnering with us to ensure the health, safety and well being of their student athlete and all those that they participate with, that creates a different challenge for us," Menzel said. "We want everyone to be able to\xc2\xa0operate in community together, and that means being up front when someone\'s sick."Scottsdale school board member Jann-Michael Greenburg said the district was looking into how to respond\xc2\xa0to parents of athletes about Schweigert\'s Facebook post, including consequences for not sharing results.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0"I think it\'s worthwhile being firm here that\xc2\xa0at no time should you be dishonest or lie just to play a sport for another week," Greenburg said. "It\'s not what I would like to see from our community.Greenburg said he empathized with how important the football season was to student athletes, but that public health and education needed to be the district\'s priorities.Failure to\xc2\xa0control the spread of the virus could quickly lead to students missing classes and teachers getting sick, he said."The most important thing for us to do is to follow the expert advice on how to handle these issues," Greenburg said.\xc2\xa0"An outbreak could really be just a massive hinderance to what we\'re really trying to achieve academically."Parents want to playSchweigert said in his post that if programs continued to shut down each time there was a positive case, "our chances to make it through a season are slim to none!"Schweigert told The Republic this week\xc2\xa0that he floated the idea of families using at-home testing resources "as a safer, better alternative"\xc2\xa0after rumors began circulating\xc2\xa0that football families were considering avoiding testing altogether."That didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like a safe approach to me," Schweigert said.He said he has since heard that\xc2\xa0the Sports Medicine Advisory Committee board and the AIA were in the process of modifying the guidelines to allow \xe2\x80\x9cclose contacts\xe2\x80\x9d of students who test positive to return immediately if they produce a negative test. \xc2\xa0"That modification to the guidelines definitely changes my perspective on it,"\xc2\xa0Schweigert said.\xc2\xa0"I think it is a much more reasonable approach."Aaron Minor, who is president of the Chaparral\xc2\xa0Football Foundation Board\xc2\xa0and whose son is a senior wide receiver at the school, said he has been in discussions with the Scottsdale district about why players were forced to quarantine for 14 days.The district announced on Sept. 30 that one player had\xc2\xa0tested positive for COVID-19, two days before Chaparral\xe2\x80\x99s opener at rival Saguaro High School. The first two games of the season were subsequently canceled.These 15 Arizona destinations named best places to travel  Can Schweikert win in Arizona\'s 6th Congressional District?  Controversy swirls over auction of state land in hot spotMinor and other parents have criticized\xc2\xa0the move to cancel the games, arguing that\xc2\xa0a single positive case did not meet the criteria for suspension of activities.An outbreak is defined as two or more COVID-19 cases among students or staff within a 14-day period, according to the AIA.\xc2\xa0According to AIA guidelines for returning to athletic activity, for every team with 25 or more players,\xc2\xa0there must be more than two\xc2\xa0positive COVID-19 cases per team to suspend athletic activity. For teams with less than 25 members, activities will be paused if there are two positive cases.In the event the number of positive cases are reached, team activities should be paused for a minimum of eight\xc2\xa0days from the last exposure of the team to the sick individual, according to the guidelines.Minor said Monday he had been in discussions with the district about their decision. "I disagree with the method with which they\xe2\x80\x99re using to say you can\xe2\x80\x99t play for two weeks. What guidance did they use, the policy of the protocol? Hopefully, they can explain that," he said.Minor said he didn\'t know anything about Schweigert\'s post advocating for hiding positive test results\xc2\xa0but acknowledged he had heard\xc2\xa0talk about "private testing.""If the kid is sick, I think he should get tested the way they want," Minor said.\xc2\xa0"The policy is in place to protect other players and other teams. I don\xe2\x80\x99t disagree with that."Menzel, the Scottsdale superintendent, said the district did not want to shut down football games, but that two student athletes have now\xc2\xa0tested positive, which meets the county\'s criteria for classifying an outbreak at the school.The district was\xc2\xa0following the guidance of the Maricopa County Department of Health in cancelling the games and quarantining players that were potentially exposed, Menzel said.Games are still scheduled for the Chaparral freshman football team, as no close contact between the teams had\xc2\xa0taken place. Chaparral is not currently open for in-person classes\xc2\xa0but is scheduled to reopen\xc2\xa0on Monday, pending the\xc2\xa0health metrics.Menzel said the district is taking steps to clarify how the county classifies cases, in addition to conducting\xc2\xa0contact tracing to determine which students and faculty may need\xc2\xa0to quarantine for a longer period of time."Ultimately our commitment is to ensuring as best we can, the health, safety and well-being of our student athletes, of our coaches, and of our larger community," Menzel said.Have a tip out of Scottsdale?
