Trump made the tweet and posted the same message to Facebook just hours after arriving back at the White House following a multi-day stay at Walter Reed medical center, where the president was treated after testing positive for COVID-19.\nFacebook took down Trumps post outright Tuesday, stating that it [removes] incorrect information about the severity of COVID-19, and have now removed this post. Twitter  hid the tweet behind a warning saying that it broke the platforms rules about spreading misleading or harmful COVID-19 misinformation.\n\n\nFlu season is coming up! Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu. Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!\n Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 6, 2020\n\nWe placed a public interest notice on this Tweet for violating our COVID-19 Misleading Information Policy by making misleading health claims about COVID-19, a Twitter spokesperson said.\nTaking down one of the presidents posts is rare but it wasnt a first for Facebook. In August, Facebook removed a video Trump shared in which he claimed that children are almost immune to COVID-19. The clip originally aired on Fox News.\nOn twitter, Trumps tweet will have significantly limited engagement, meaning that it cant be retweeted without quoting, liked or replied to, but it will remain up because its in the public interest. By the time Twitter took action on the tweet it had more than 59,000 retweets and 186,000 likes.\n\nFacebook and Twitter both created new policies to address the spread of pandemic-related misinformation earlier this year. In the pandemics earlier days, the false claim that COVID is comparable to the flu was a common refrain from Trump and his allies, who wished to downplay the severity of the virus. But after months of the virus raging through communities around the U.S., the claim that COVID-19 is like the flu is an even more glaring lie.\n\nFacebook just took down a Trump post that claimed kids are immune to COVID-19\n\nWhile much remains not understood about the virus, it can follow an aggressive and unpredictable trajectory in patients, attacking vital organs beyond the lungs and leaving people who contracted it with long-lasting health effects that are not yet thoroughly studied or understood. Trumps own physician has said the president may not be out of the woods yet in his own fight with the virus.\nIn recent months, the presidents social media falsehoods had shifted more toward lies about the safety of vote-by-mail, the system many Americans will rely on to cast votes as the pandemic rages on.\nBut less than a day out of a multi-day stay at the hospital, where he was given supplemental oxygen and three experimental treatments, its clear Trumps own diagnosis with the virus doesnt mean he intends to treat with any seriousness at all the health threat thats upended the economy and claimed more than 200,000 lives in the U.S.\nInstead, Trump is poised to continue waging a political war against platforms like Twitter and Facebook \xe2\x80\x94 if the results of the election give him the chance. Trump has already expressed interest in dismantling Section 230, a key legal provision that protects platforms from liability for user-generated content.\n\nSection 230 will be on the chopping block at the next big tech hearing\n\nHe tweeted REPEAL SECTION 230!!! Tuesday after Twitter and Facebook took action against his posts saying the flu is worse than COVID-19.\n\nTrumps fight with COVID-19 adds fresh fuel to the misinformation fire he started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
