The growing gap between a few at the top and the rest of society damages us all. No longer able to deny the crisis, every government in the world is now pledged to fix it  and yet it keeps on getting worse.\xa0In this book, international anti-inequality campaigner Ben Phillips shows why winning the debate is not enough: we have to win the fight. Drawing on his insider experience, and his personal exchanges with the real-life heroes of successful movements, he shows how the battle against inequality has been won before, and he shares a practical plan for defeating inequality again. He sets a route map for us to overcome deference, build our collective power, and create a new story.\xa0Most books on inequality are about what other people ought to do about it  this book is about why winning the fight needs you. Tired of feeling helpless in the face of spiralling inequality? Want to know what you can do about it? This is the book for you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nShow More\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nBuy Now\nFrom Wiley.com\n\n\nOrder Exam Copy\nFor Lecturers Only\n\n\n\n\nMore Info\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 2020\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n150 pages\n138 x 216 mm / 5 x 9 in\n\n\n\n\nAvailable Formats\n\n\nHardback\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                            $59.95\n\n9781509543083\nPaperback\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                    $19.95\n\n9781509543090\nOpen eBook\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                    $9.99\n\n9781509543106\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBen Phillips\xa0is co-founder of the Fight Inequality Alliance, civil society activist, and writer.\n\n\n\nShow More\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis powerful book makes clear why we cannot rely on elites to fix inequality and why it is up to us, together. Ben Phillips introduces us to the frontline heroes of the fight against inequality, and shows how we have won previous struggles and can win now.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Winnie Byanyima, former\xc2\xa0executive director of\xc2\xa0Oxfam International\xe2\x80\x9cInequality would not be a major issue around the world without the work of Ben Phillips. He has helped mobilize people power to transform the imbalances that destabilize our economies and scar our communities. This practical book empowers readers with the data, information, arguments and advice they need to be able to help bring an end to this crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ann Pettifor, author\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0The Case for the Green New\xc2\xa0Deal\xe2\x80\x9cBen Phillips is a stalwart campaigner for a fairer world. How to Fight Inequality is a handy primer to help people to build power together.\xe2\x80\x9dJohn Githongo\xe2\x80\x9cBen Phillips has helped bring global attention to the inequality crisis. How to Fight Inequality is an ideal guide for anyone who wants to help. He brings to the book lessons and stories from a lifetime deeply enmeshed in activism and organising, finding hope not in famous leaders but in everyday people, and helping set out how each of us can get engaged in building a more equal society.\xe2\x80\x9dNaila Kabeer\xe2\x80\x9cWe now know just how harmful inequality is to us all. But can anything be done about it? Ben Phillips\xe2\x80\x99s smart new book is packed with powerful stories of change won from the ground up, helps guide us in what we can do by organising together, and demonstrates that a more equal future is ours to make.\xe2\x80\x9dKate Pickett\xe2\x80\x9cInequality defines our present but it is not our fate.

The debates have been won, but the problem keeps getting worse. Now we must win the fight.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And there can be no spectators: it is up to you and me to make change happen.
