We take every opportunity to advance equality for women and girls, and we will always proudly defend life and human dignity.\nWe are gravely concerned that authoritarian governments are using the COVID-19 pandemic to justify unwarranted crackdowns on their citizens and on civil society. You know, I cannot help but remember Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor who was reprimanded for trying to warn the world about a troubling cluster of infection in Wuhan, and later succumbed to the coronavirus. The systemic repression of freedom of association, assembly, and expression, stunts the capacity of society to respond to COVID. Indeed, the Chinese Communist Party\xe2\x80\x99s stifling of such freedoms transformed a local epidemic into a global pandemic which threatens to set back decades of developmental and economic gains. The Chinese people simply deserve better.\nThe United States leads in humanitarian assistance for COVID-19, having contributed more than $9 billion globally. While we acknowledge significant donors, we cannot and should not do this alone. More donors must share in this responsibility.\nThe United States is deeply concerned by many governments\xe2\x80\x99 ongoing abuses of fundamental human rights, including those which will be detailed in subsequent interventions on Myanmar, the DPRK, Nicaragua, Cuba, Belarus, Yemen, and Cameroon.\nIn regard to the People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic of China, we are disappointed by Chinese attempts to divert attention from its horrendous disregard for human rights and paint mounting global concerns \xe2\x80\x93 as expressed by 39 countries yesterday \xe2\x80\x93 as a bilateral issue, accusing the United States of lying, when the world sees Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s cruelty on display. More than 50 independent UN experts have called for collective action to ensure China abides by its human rights obligations. We are alarmed by the Chinese Communist Party\xe2\x80\x99s continued arbitrary detention of over one million Uyghurs and other minority groups in internment camps in Xinjiang. The Chinese government\xe2\x80\x99s claim it provided so-called \xe2\x80\x9cvocational training\xe2\x80\x9d to nearly 7.8 million workers in Xinjiang in the last six years is concerning, given the pervasive nature of state-sponsored forced labor schemes in Xinjiang. We are also deeply disturbed by the reports that the Chinese Communist Party is using sterilization, forced abortion, and coercive family planning as part of its continuing campaign of repression. The Chinese Communist Party has eroded autonomy and liberty in Hong Kong and perpetrated a wide range of human rights abuses against members of minority communities, including Africans and Tibetans, as well as lawyers and human rights defenders across China.\nThe United States condemns the wide-scale human rights abuses committed by the Assad regime in Syria. The UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry has documented thousands of credible cases of extrajudicial killings, torture, and violations of international humanitarian law that have led to 6.6 million Syrians being displaced inside the country, 11 million in need of humanitarian assistance, and 5.5 million registered as refugees in nearby countries. The regime\xe2\x80\x99s decade-long barbaric campaigning of killing, torture, detention, and impunity must end immediately.\nThe United States remains gravely concerned by gross human rights violations in Iran, including death sentences imposed following unfair trials and forced confessions reportedly obtained through torture. Impunity for the killings of up to 1,500 protesters in November 2019 and the continued repression of members of religious minority groups must end now.\nVenezuelan citizens suffer as the corrupt, illegitimate Maduro regime enriches its officials, commits extensive human rights abuses, and blocks the holding of free and fair elections needed to restore democracy. In September, the UN Independent Fact-Finding Mission assessed there are reasonable grounds to believe the regime has committed crimes against humanity.\nIn Russia, we are troubled by continued threats, harassment, and violence against the press, independent civil society, religious and other minority groups, and the political opposition. The United States is also alarmed by reported cases of enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings, particularly in Chechnya. We condemn Russia\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing aggression in eastern Ukraine and its invasion of Crimea. We call on Russia to implement its Minsk agreement commitments.\n###\n\nBy United States Mission to the United Nations | 7 October, 2020 | Topics: Highlights, Remarks and Highlights\n\nSuggested for You\n\n\nRemarks at a Third Committee Interactive Dialogue with the High Commissioner for Human Rights (via VTC)\n\n\nRemarks at a Third Committee Interactive Dialogue with the Director of the New York Office for OHCHR (via VTC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilterKeyword(s):Content Type: Highlights RemarksMonth/Year October 2020September 2020August 2020July 2020June 2020May 2020April 2020March 2020February 2020January 2020December 2019November 2019October 2019September 2019August 2019July 2019June 2019May 2019April 2019March 2019February 2019January 2019December 2018November 2018October 2018September 2018August 2018July 2018June 2018May 2018April 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017October 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017Topics\n\nHighlights\n\nRemarks\n\nRemarks and Highlights\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nShow More Recent PostsRemarks at a Third Committee Interactive Dialogue with the High Commissioner for Human Rights (via VTC)Remarks at a Third Committee Interactive Dialogue with the Director of the New York Office for OHCHR (via VTC)Remarks at a UN Security Council Briefing on the Situation in the Great LakesRemarks at a Tribute to the Memory of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah of the State of KuwaitRemarks at a Third Committee Interactive Dialogue on the Sale and Sexual Exploitation of Children, A.I. 72(b) (via VTC) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. MISSION TO THE UNOur Leaders\nAbout the Mission\nHighlights\nRemarks\nContact Us\nPrivacy\nSitemap\n \nU.S. Mission United States Mission to the United Nations\n799 United Nations Plaza\nNew York, NY 10017\nTwitterFacebookFlickrInstagram\n RELATED LINKS The White House\nState Department\nUnited Nations\nModel UN Programs\nStudent Programs\nUS State Department Bureau of International Organization Affairs\nArchived Content 2009 - 2017\n \n\nEmail Subscription \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Disclaimer This is the official website of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations.
