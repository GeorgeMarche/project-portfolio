The new case, from the Goulburn Mulwaree Shire, is a close contact of a Sydney case reported on October 7 and has been in isolation since being tested on October 7. The Public Health Unit is working closely with this case and has been in touch with their contacts and directed any close contacts to isolate for 14 days and immediately get tested.\n Isolation is mandatory for anyone identified as a close contact (not a casual contact) of a case. \n READ ALSO: 'Dangerous' provisional driver caught travelling 132km/h while using mobile phone\n Anyone directed to undertake a 14-day self-isolation period must stay in isolation for the full time, even if they test negative. Early testing may not detect an infection, therefore ceasing self-isolation based on a negative test could allow an infectious person to infect others in the community. \n Most people who are infected and develop symptoms will do so within 14 days of exposure. For further advice, call SNSWLHD 1800 999 880 COVID line to speak with a registered nurse who can provide advice relevant to your particular situation. During peak times you may be asked to leave your details for a nurse to return your call. If you have concerns while waiting for the call-back, please isolate until you have spoken with a nurse who can advise you on the appropriate action to take. SNSWLHD is urging anyone feeling unwell - even with the mildest of symptoms such as a runny nose, scratchy or sore throat, cough, fever, shortness of breath, headache, tiredness, loss of taste or smell, nausea, diarrhoea or muscle aches - to self-isolate and seek COVID-19 testing, so cases in the community can be identified as quickly as possible. There is no longer a requirement to schedule appointments at most of the district's COVID-19 testing sites. \n Callers to the SNSWLHD 1800 999 880 COVID line will be provided with information on testing eligibility and clinic times and locations. For testing local clinic times and locations, visit: https://www.snswlhd.health.nsw.gov.au/our-services/infectious-disease/covid-19. It remains essential that everyone maintains social distancing and good hygiene to minimise the risk of spread between people. People can unwittingly pass COVID-19 to others if they are incubating the virus or have very mild symptoms. COVID-19 continues to circulate in the community and we must all be vigilant. To help stop the spread of COVID-19: NSW Health thanks the community for all they have done towards reducing COVID-19 numbers and continues to ask people to remain vigilant and come forward for testing immediately if symptoms appear. This is particularly important with school holidays and increased movement of people around the state. We depend on subscription revenue to support our journalism.
