It has been a week since her infection was confirmed, and the FLOTUS is noticeably inactive on social media after her diagnosis was released to the public.\nMelanias first tweet since diagnosis\nShe only tweeted once since contacting the virus, but she doesnt give details about her health condition or share how she is doing these days. Her latest Twitter post was about the foster youth event that she wished she could have attended.\nOn Oct. 7, she tweeted, While I wish I could have joined @SecretaryCarson today as planned, Im glad to see the incredible work @HUDgov is doing with #FYI to make sure our foster youth have a safe place to call home. The FLOTUS also added the hashtag #BeBest.\nThe First Ladys health condition\nMelania Trump did not mention about her progress in fighting COVID-19, so the public is wondering how she is doing. The question was answered by her chief of staff, Stephanie Grisham. "She continues to feel well," she told USA TODAY.\nThe First Lady only has mild symptoms of COVID-19 and she previously shared that she is feeling good. She also thanked the medical staff who are taking care of her and those who have been praying for her and Donald Trumps full recovery.\nAt any rate, most of the White House staff and officials who had close contacts with Melania Trump, the POTUS and others who tested positive for the virus, are also quarantining. They are working from home and in isolation from their families.\nThe presidents fast recovery \nMeanwhile, as Melania Trump continues to be monitored and receive care to recover fast from COVID-19, her husband Donald Trump has already returned to the White House after spending three nights at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland.\nHe is back to work in the Oval Office, a move that is being slammed by doctors, the public and politicians. This is because, with his stubborn attitude, he is putting people around him in danger. They are exposing them to the virus despite his claims that he has fully recovered just days after testing positive. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconoTimes \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87\xe7\x89\x88 \xe7\xbb\x8f\xe5\xae\xa2\xe6\x97\xb6\xe4\xbb\xa3\xe5\xb7\xb2\xe4\xb8\x8a\xe7\xba\xbf\n\xe6\xb7\xb1\xe5\x85\xa5\xe4\xba\x86\xe8\xa7\xa3\xe4\xb8\xad\xe5\x9b\xbd\xe5\x8a\xa8\xe5\x90\x91\n\xe5\xbc\x80\xe5\xa7\x8b\xe9\x98\x85\xe8\xaf\xbb >\n\n\nEconotimes China Edition\nGET INSIGHTS IN CHINESE\nREAD NOW >\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor\'s Picks\n\n\n\n\n How will coronavirus affect property prices?\n\n\n\n\n How chronic stress changes the brain \xe2\x80\x93 and what you can do to reverse the damage\n\n\n\n\n Should you listen to music when you work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Antipsychotics can be life-changing, but they can also put patients at risk\n\n\n\n\n Don\'t blame dating apps for your terrible love life\n\n\n\n\n 4 ways to protect yourself from disinformation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Why Japanese yen is still one of the safest places to park your money in a market crash\n\n\n\n\n Google wants to move UK users\' data to the US \xe2\x80\x93 what does that mean for your rights?\n\n\n\n\n For decades, scientists puzzled over the plastic \'missing\' from our oceans \xe2\x80\x93 but now it\'s been found\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Data\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Data by TradingView\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\t\n\n\n\n1\n\n \n                                                                                                America\xe2\x80\x99s Roundup: Dollar holds gains on safety bid as uncertainty grows on several fronts, Wall Street closes lower, Gold steady, Oil rises nearly 2% as robust China trade data offsets returning supply-October 14th,2020\n\n\n\n2\n\n \n                                                                                                FxWirePro: USD/SEK extends rebound from 3-week low, faces resistance at 21-EMA\n \n\n\n3\n\n \n                                                                                                FxWirePro: USD/DKK at 1-week peak, break above 55-EMA likely\xc2\xa0\n \n\n\n4\n\n \n                                                                                                Asia Roundup: Aussie rises as consumer sentiment improves, greenback hold gains amid renewed concerns over coronavirus vaccine, Asian shares plunge - Wednesday, October 14th, 2020\n\n\n\n5\n\n \n                                                                                                FxWirePro: EUR/NZD   falls on poor German ZEW investor morale, plunge to test a key fibo grows\n \n\n\n6\n\n \n                                                                                                FxWirePro: USD/JPY erases early losses, outlook remains bearish as long as pair holds below 21-EMA resistance\n \n\n\n7\n\n \n                                                                                                Gold off near 1-week low as vaccine trials, stimulus talks stall\n\n\n\n8\n\n \n                                                                                                FxWirePro: AUD/USD extends marginal gains after upbeat Australia\'s Consumer Confidence data, scope for deeper correction\n \n\n\n9\n\n \n                                                                                                COVID-19 cure: UVC light destroys 99.9% of coronavirus, according to a study\n \n\n\n10\n\n \n                                                                                                Trade Idea EURUSD (Intraday)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconoTimes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top \xe2\x96\xb2\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n\n                        \n                        \xa9Elmin Media .
