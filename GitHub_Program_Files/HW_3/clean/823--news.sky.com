And so I think that\'s a problem."You may have a lot of people who are out in the society and they\'re not self-isolating because they didn\'t know that they are positive." \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird of Britons face lockdown measures - what are they in your area?\n \n\n\n\nProfessor Tim Spector of King\'s College London, who leads the COVID Symptom Study (CSS) app, warned that the research does not mean people will not have symptoms at all for the length of their infection.He said data from more than four million people who used the app and reported symptoms over a week found that 85% of adults reported having a fever, cough or a loss of taste or smell.He added: "But the data on children and the over-65s from the CSS app tell us a different story."Only using the UK\'s three classic symptoms will miss around 50% of cases in these important groups that were included in the ONS survey."In a sub-study at King\'s College London of twins using antibody testing and the ability to report 20 different symptoms, we showed that only 19% of people are truly asymptomatic."We need to learn from other countries and improve awareness of all the symptoms of COVID-19 to properly control the spread of the virus." \n:: Subscribe to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, SpreakerProfessor Paul Hunter at the University of East Anglia said the UCL study could not show the proportion of people with COVID who become symptomatic or remained asymptomatic at some stage of their infection, as it only checked if they had external signs of infection when they actually took the test.He said: "Anyone who was previously symptomatic and had now recovered or who were currently incubating the infection and would develop symptoms within the following hours would not be included as being symptomatic in this study."A government spokesman said ministers are aiming to increase testing capacity to 500,000 a day by the end of October.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                About Sky News\n                                Down\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nSky Data\n\n\nSky News International\n\n\nSky News Library Sales\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\nEditorial Guidelines\n\n\nSupreme Court Live\n\n\nSky News Board\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Sky News Services\n                                Down\n\n\n\nSky News RSS\n\n\nSky News For Your Phone\n\n\nSky News Radio\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Sky Channels\n                                Down\n\n\n\nSky 1\n\n\nSky Witness\n\n\nSky Atlantic\n\n\nSky Arts\n\n\nSky Cinema\n\n\nSky Sports\n\n\n\n\n\n                                More Sky Sites\n                                Down\n\n\n\nNOW TV\n\n\nSky Ocean Rescue\n\n\nSky Academy Studios\n\n\nBigger Picture\n\n\nSky Corporate\n\n\nSky Bet\n\n\nSky.com\n\n\nSky News Arabia\n\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\n\nPrivacy & Cookies\n\n\nPrivacy Options\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n \xc2\xa9 2020 Sky UK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
