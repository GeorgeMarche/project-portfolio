Around ten years ago, I tore my right ACL playing basketball and after a long and painful recovery lasting 8 months to a year, I struggled to regain my fitness, but returned to playing sport. After 2/3 years of training and playing I ruptured my left ACL. This time, I went to a different surgeon. Both experiences with the surgeons were similar, somewhat impersonal.\n\n\n\n                            Read more\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                Bernice Molony \n                            \nMelbourne, Australia\n\n\n\nACL RECONSTRUCTION\n"Exceptionally Professional Surgery & Follow-Up"\nI had a skiing accident and ruptured my ACL.

I had rehabilitated plenty of ACL patients, some of which Mihai had operated on, but never saw a live surgery. It was a cold call and I wasn\'t expecting a reply as I had contacted other surgeons also without response. I received a prompt reply with an invitation to visit his OR and spend some time speaking to him about his surgical approach & his rehab protocols.\n\n\n\n                            Read more\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                David Harrison \n                            \nCo Roscommon\n\n\n\nGENERAL PRACTITIONER\nAn absolute gentleman and highly skilled surgeon\nI have dealt with Mihai as both a GP and as a patient. I am a GP in Roscommon and ruptured my cruciate ligament on the GAA pitch in Sept, 2014, 5 weeks before my wedding day. I wanted to get it sorted and on the road to recovery ASAP.
