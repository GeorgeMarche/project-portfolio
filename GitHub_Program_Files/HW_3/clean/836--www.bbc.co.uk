watch the matchCumbria Police say they\'ve become aware of plans by football fans from Scotland to come to Cumbrian pubs and social clubs this weekend to watch a Celtic v Rangers match where the Covid-19 regulations are slightly more relaxed.They\'re now using social media and other means to tell intending visitors from across the border, and licensees, that coronavirus regulations such as the "rule of six" will be enforced, and officers will fine people if necessary.GoogleCopyright: GoogleThere are stricter rules currently in place north of the border, where people from only two households can  socialise indoors, so an afternoon watching a match in a pub with friends would contravene the regulations.In England the rule of six applies, but there can be people from different households, although this would go against the advice of the Cumbrian authorities.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these
