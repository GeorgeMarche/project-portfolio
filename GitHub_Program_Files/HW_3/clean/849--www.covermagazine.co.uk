However, research from Vitality has shown that the Covid-19 crisis has also prompted people to consider their life insurance needs. \xa0\nAccording to the survey of 2000 consumers, one in 10 (10%) said one of the biggest life lessons to come from the Covid-19 pandemic is the need to protect themselves and their family\'s future with life insurance. It also found that three in five (59%) had realised that life is too short and that anything can happen to them or their families.\n\n\n\nRelated articles\n\n\n\n\n\nBupa launches stand-alone business proposition\n\n\nHundreds of thousands miss out on urgent cancer referrals\n\n\nVitalityLife introduces \'immediate\' access to underwriting decisions\n\n\n\'Biggest ever\' EAP data analysis reveals ROI for UK employers\n\n\n\n\nMore than a third of people said that the pandemic has made them more aware of the need for life insurance, rising to more than half for those aged between 25 and 34.\nThe pandemic has also led people to reassess what is important in life, the research showed, with the top priorities for most people proving to be spending more time with family (28%), improving health by losing weight (22%), improving mental health and emotional wellbeing (20%), taking better care of personal finances (19%) and making healthier choices with what they eat (18%).\nHowever, despite the desire to make changes by so many people, almost a quarter are less optimistic about achieving long-term goals now, than before the pandemic and one in seven (15%) admitted they feel unsure about the future and don\'t know what to do next.\nTo help people focus on personal resilience and face the future, Vitality is partnering with life coach Jacqueline Hurst for a virtual life coaching workshop at 10am on Vitality\'s Facebook page on 15 October.\n\'Financial safety net\'\nDeepak Jobanputra, managing director, VitalityLife said: "The coronavirus pandemic has changed the way we live our lives and what we consider to be important, and while it has prompted many people to make changes in their lives, many don\'t know where to start and feel uncertain about the future.\n"At Vitality we have always sought to go beyond simply providing a product, but looking holistically at the health and wellbeing of our members. Today\'s research shows that in addition to people seeking protection, they are also looking for support and help at this difficult time and I hope the workshop, will help many people make decisions to help safeguard their futures.\n"We want to help more people feel confident about the future, and we believe that protection products not only provide a financial safety net against unexpected financial shocks but also provide peace of mind that what matters most to them is protected against uncertainty or unexpected events in the future."\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo fifths of consumers \'changed mind\' about insurance due to Covid\n\n\nIndividual Protection\n\n\n\n06 October 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvisers seeing increased protection interest\n\n\nAdviser / Broking\n\n\n\n01 July 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\nSend to\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nIndividual Protection\n\n\nCOVID-19\n\n\npandemic\n\n\nprotection\n\n\nlife insurance \n\n\nmajor life event\n\n\nVitality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on Individual Protection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVitalityLife introduces \'immediate\' access to underwriting decisions\n\nTwo changes to be rolled out this month\n\n\n\nUnderwriting\n\n\n\n14 October 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVER Excellence Awards: Intermediary shortlist announced!\n\nWinners revealed on 10 November\n\n\n\nAdviser / Broking\n\n\n\n13 October 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy PMI and protection advice do not need to be mutually exclusive\n\nThe benefits of dual advice\n\n\n\nAdviser / Broking\n\n\n\n12 October 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne in four feeling \'lonely and isolated\' during Covid\n\nNearly 60% of young people reported anxiety and stress\n\n\n\nIndividual Protection\n\n\n\n09 October 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtection Review Awards 2020: Shortlists announced\n\nOnline event on 9 December\n\n\n\nIndividual Protection\n\n\n\n09 October 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nblog comments powered by Disqus\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n L&G: What\'s being done to clean up UK protection distribution? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Revealed: Winners of the 2020 Women in Financial Advice Awards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n COVER Excellence Awards: Intermediary shortlist announced!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Covid-19\xe2\x80\xa6 a major life event triggering protection interest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Fliss\' story: Cancer treatment during Covid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\nMarketing services\nAbout Incisive Media\nTerms and conditions\nPolicies\nCareers\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\nLinkedIn\n \n\n\nNewsletters\n \n\n\nYouTube\n \n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa9 Incisive Business Media (IP) Limited, Published by Incisive Business Media Limited, New London House, 172 Drury Lane, London WC2B 5QR, registered in England and Wales with company registration numbers 09177174 & 09178013\n\n\nDigital publisher of the year\nDigital publisher of the year 2010, 2013, 2016 & 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
