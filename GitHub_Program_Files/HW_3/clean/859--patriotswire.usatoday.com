That plan also flew in the face of what we know about the novel coronavirus. COVID-19 has an incubation period of two to 14 days, according to the CDC, and so we could see cases stem from quarterback Cam Newton, who contracted the disease last Friday, for roughly eight more days. Yet the NFL asked the Patriots to get on a plane and get into a locker room, where the disease could spread between players and staffers. It was an all-around bad decision.\n\nSo even though New England lost to Kansas City in devastating fashion and even though the Patriots are set to face the Broncos in Week 5, its hard to discuss football, because of the possibility that the teams cannot play.\nBut we did talk football  along with plenty of COVID-19 discussion  on this weeks Patriots Wire podcast.\n\n\nGallery\nPatriots player power rankings after Week 4: QBs plummet along with Julian Edelman\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nView\n\t\t\t\t56 photos\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tShare this article\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t55 shares\n\t\t\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tshare\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\ttweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\ttext\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\temail\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tlink\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\ton Facebook\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\ton Twitter\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\tvia text message\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\ton LinkedIn\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\tvia email\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\thttps://patriotswire.usatoday.com/2020/10/08/podcast-why-the-nfl-put-the-patriots-in-a-terrible-situation-with-covid-19/\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nLike this article?\nSign up for the Patriots Wire newsletter to get our top stories in your inbox every morning\n\n\nEmail\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSign me up\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tView all newsletters\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Stories\n\n\n \n\nHow Jimmy Garoppolo and the Patriots could reunite\n\n\n\n\nHenry McKenna \n\nOctober 8, 2020\n\n\n\nThe timing for a Jimmy Garoppolo reunion is lining up for the New England Patriots if they find they want to pursue their old backup quarterback. It doesn't make perfect sense, but there is a scenario where the Patriots might be interested in trading for Garoppolo -- or even signing him, if the 49ers were to cut him.\nSan Francisco benched Garoppolo on Sunday, but for now, let's avoid viewing the move as a death knell for his tenure with the 49ers. The quarterback has been dealing with an ankle injury, and coach Kyle Shanahan explained away the decision...\n\n\nRead the full article \n\n\n\n\nFrom The Web\nAds by Zergnet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNFL fans joked about the Patriots and Le'Veon Bell, but the match doesn't make sense\n\n\n\n\nHenry McKenna \n\nOctober 8, 2020\n\n\n\nJust as soon as the New York Jets decided to release running back Le'Veon Bell, NFL fans thought he might be headed to the New England Patriots. It's a Twitter-honored tradition for fans to connect the Patriots to just about every veteran who is in need of a career reclamation.\nSo the Bell transaction led to a round of jokes: When are the Patriots going to sign him for the veteran minimum? After all, he made $28 million across 18 games played for New York. He's 28 years old and might be interested in helping Bill Belichick, Cam Newton and...\n\n\nRead the full article \n\n\n\n\n \n\nShould the Patriots attempt to trade for Bengals WR A.J. Green?\n\n\n\n\nIsaiah Houde \n\nOctober 8, 2020\n\n\n\nAfter five weeks of football, it's pretty obvious the New England Patriots could use some help at the wide receiver position.\nBill Belichick's team isn't desperate for help on the outside because of Cam Newton's impact, but the need is still there. Through four games, the second-best receiver has been Damiere Byrd, with N'Keal Harry trailing for a close third. Julian Edelman's numbers are inflated, considering the fact that more than half of his yards came from one game.\nNewton's ability to rush, along with the team's ability to pound the ball has opened up opportunities for receivers and keeps the...\n\n\nRead the full article \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tShare this article\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t55 shares\n\t\t\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tshare\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\ttweet\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\ttext\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\temail\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tlink\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\ton Facebook\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\ton Twitter\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\tvia text message\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\ton LinkedIn\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\tvia email\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\thttps://patriotswire.usatoday.com/2020/10/08/podcast-why-the-nfl-put-the-patriots-in-a-terrible-situation-with-covid-19/\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n \n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nStephon Gilmore's wife refutes a report on Cam Newton and the CB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWill Cam Newton, Stephon Gilmore be present at Wednesday's practice?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nReport: Patriots get zero positive COVID-19 tests, and get closer to reopening facility\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nJulian Edelman shows love for Dak Prescott after brutal injury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBill Belichick says the Patriots are on track to play Sunday vs. the Broncos\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow PatriotsWire!\n\n\n\nGet the day's top stories\n\n\nEmail\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSign up\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Patriots stories in your feed\n\non Facebook\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\non Twitter\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\xa9 Copyright Patriots Wire 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nYour California Privacy Rights/Privacy Policy\nDo No Sell My Info/Cookie Policy\nCorrections\n \n\n\nPowered by WordPress.com VIP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError\n\n\t\t\tPlease enter an email address.\t\t\n\n\n\n\nSuccess\nThanks for signing up.\nPlease check your email for a confirmation.\n\n\n\n\nError\n\n\t\t\tSomething went wrong.\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
