Oxygen deficiency can\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed to patients suffering from COVID-19, Desai said.\xa0\nHowever, the government decided to allocate the 80 per cent of oxygen for the treatment of COVID-19 patients has caused a huge shortage in supply to the industries. Desai was speaking at an online meeting with oxygen suppliers and entrepreneurs.\xa0\nIn the meeting, a detailed discussion was held on the issue of shortage in supply of oxygen to the industries. MIDC CEO P. Anbalgan, Industry Development Commissioner Harshdeep Kamble, Gas Association President Saket Tikoo were present during the meeting.\xa0\nDesai said that Maharashtra was witnessing a decline in fresh COVID-19 cases and the requirement of oxygen was also decreasing. He said that the oxygen supply for industrial units will normalise soon but it was government\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to ensure that the oxygen is made available for medical requirement amid the coronavirus pandemic.\xa0\nThe state is currently producing 1,000 metric tonnes of oxygen on a daily basis. Of these, the industrial units require 600 metric tonnes of oxygen. The state is trying to increase its production capacity to 1,300 metric tonnes.\xa0\nIndustries should try to make up for the shortage of oxygen supply, Desai said. He added that the priority will be given to the treatment of COVID-19 patients in Maharashtra.\xa0Also Read -\xa0BJP Must Apologise: Maharashtra Home Minister Anil DeshmukhMaharashtra Governor Calls For Effective Implementation Of Women And Child Welfare SchemesShift Biomedical Waste Plant Out Of Mumbai Within A Year: Maharashtra Environment Minister Aaditya ThackerayRead this story in  \xe0\xa4\xae\xe0\xa4\xb0\xe0\xa4\xbe\xe0\xa4\xa0\xe0\xa5\x80RELATED TOPICSoxygen cylindercoronavirussubhash desaimaharashtraOxygen SupplyIndustiesCOVID-19\xa0 Loading next story...Latest NewsRailway Officials Recommend Using Colour-Coded QR Tickets for Commuters Based on TimingsAmazon Great Indian Festival: Here are A Few Tech Deals You Can ExpectNCP leader Sanjay Shinde passes away; burns alive after car catches fire in NashikCPI(M) demands sacking of Maharashtra Governor for mocking secularismSometimes \'certificate\' is required: Amruta Fadnavis slams CM ThackerayGadkari suggests measures to control flood situation in Mumbai; writes to CMAdvertisementPoliticsFoul play can\'t be ruled out: Nitin Raut on power outage in MMR"Shocked and Surprised": Sharad Pawar on Maharashtra Governor\'s letter to ThackerayOur Hindutva is firm: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ABOUT US THE GUIDEBOOK TERMS & CONDITIONS PRIVACY POLICY FEEDBACK CONTACT US SITEMAPMumbai Local SportsMumbai BMCMumbai Live UpdatesMumbai Train UpdatesMumbai Traffic UpdatesLatest News in MumbaiEvents in MumbaiMumbai RainsMumbai WeatherMumbai Food Places\nBest Street Food in MumbaiBest Places to Visit in MumbaiMumbai Tourism PlacesEntertainment News in MumbaiBEST BusesMumbai PoliceAareyMumbai LocalMumbai Local TrainsMumbai Metro\nMumbai RoadsMumbai Politics NewsMumbai Food ReviewsMumbai TransportUddhav ThackerayMaha Vikas AghadiAaditya ThackerayShiv SenaMumbai IndiansRaj Thackeray News\nMNSCoronavirus Live UpdatesCoronavirus in MumbaiCOVID-19 in MumbaiCoronavirus cases in MumbaiCoronavirus in DharaviLockdown in MumbaiContainment Zones in MumbaiRajesh TopeCricket in Mumbai\nCoastal Road ProjectSharad PawarA Zenlive Media Private Limited Venture | \xa9 2020 Mumbai Live.
