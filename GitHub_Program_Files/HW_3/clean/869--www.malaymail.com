Postponing it is too easy a way out of taking responsibility for the important job that has been entrusted to them (EC),\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nJayum was also quick to point out that the situation now should work in GPS\xe2\x80\x99 favour.\nHe said there was no correlation between voting for or turning against GPS in the next state election if it is called during the pandemic.\nGPS, backed by dominant component Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB), stood a good chance of being returned to power regardless of when state polls is called, he pointed out.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is based on the fact that it is the only coalition that is highly organised and disciplined,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nThis is in contrast to an array of opposition parties that were basically disorganised, lacking grassroots machineries and lacking resources and good candidates, he said.\nHe said good candidates were people with a solid background, are known for their work and success as well as people who could be role models, instead of those relatively unknown that some parties have paraded as their potential candidates.\nWhen asked if having the state polls now would also be an advantage for GPS because of a possible low-voter turnout as some Sarawakians residing outside the state might not be able to return, Jayum said any government would usually try to capitalise on such a situation.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe government of the day calls the election. And it calls an election when it feels that the situation is in its favour. This is an effective strategy for all ruling governments anywhere and it won\xe2\x80\x99t be a unique call by GPS.\xe2\x80\x9d\nJayum also believed voter turnout was not a big issue.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn some countries, voters cast their vote in their place of residence. So your voting station should be consistent with where you are staying and working.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be fair as you help decide what kind of representative or representation you want in your place of residence or work and not vote elsewhere where you do not feature or live in a voting district that you have long left due to work,\xe2\x80\x9d he stressed.\nJayum felt that non-residents should not continue to influence voting in their former electoral districts if they have long ago.\nAnother political analyst, Prof James Chin, said now was the best time for GPS to call the polls because the situation would work in its favour now that the state opposition is not ready especially when parties are in the midst of negotiating seats.\nHowever GPS may have its own internal problem, he claimed.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a strong rumour that a component wants to move base from Bintulu to Sibu. Apart from that there is an overlapping seats problem,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chin, referring to the Progressive Democratic Party (PDP).\nChin also reckoned that the possibility of a lower voter turnout was only significant in the rural areas because Sarawakians, mostly rural folks, working outside Sarawak would not be able to return due to the movement control order (MCO) and strict standard operating procedures imposed to contain transmission of Covid-19.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn term of voters punishing GPS if an election is to be called now, that would not likely happen because the State government has been seen as successful in containing the Covid-19 virus,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nChin claimed the poor would wish for the election to be called immediately because the election campaign would be like a celebration for them.\n\xe2\x80\x9cElection means money on the ground celebrations. Almost everything is free. An election is the biggest celebration outside Christmas and Gawai,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nHaving said that, Chin said calling for the state election remains in the hand of Abang Johari, who is also GPS chairman and PBB president.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are for and against answers on the argument of whether the election should be held during this pandemic. It is up to Abang Johari on whether he wants an election now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nHowever, Assoc Prof Awang Azman Awang Pawi said it would be wise to wait for the number of Covid-19 cases to go down to two digits and that such numbers remain consistent before elections are called.\nThis is to reduce public fear and provide them confidence to attend events and go out and vote, he reasoned.\nIn any case, the election could be postponed if the government declared a state of emergency due to worsening pandemic situation, he pointed out.\nAwang Azman also said the Covid-19 pandemic should not be used by GPS as a political advantage to win the next election.\nInstead there should be \xe2\x80\x98gentleman politics\xe2\x80\x99 during the next state polls, he said.\nHe said voters might turn on GPS if the election is being held now because the coalition would then be seen not only as being careless but also not learning from Sabah when the number of Covid-19 cases there surged drastically during its recent snap election.\nThe current term of the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly expires in April next year. \xe2\x80\x94 Borneo Post Online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\nItaly coronavirus cases surge to new daily record above 7,000\nEducation Dept: Two more Labuan schools ordered closed after students test positive for Covid-19\nTop seed Fognini out of Sardinia tennis after testing positive for coronavirus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Malaysia\n\nLoading...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nMalaysia\nSingapore\nWorld\nMoney\nLife\nEat/Drink\nShowbiz\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\nWhat You Think\nSports\nTech/Gadgets\nDrive\nVideos\nCOVID-19\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nArchives\nAbout Us\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nAdvertise with Us\n\n\n\nDownload\n\nApple AppStore\nGoogle Play Store\nHuawei App Gallery\nGoogle News\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to Newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa9 2020, Malay Mail, All Rights Reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
