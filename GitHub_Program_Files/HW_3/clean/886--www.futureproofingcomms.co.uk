It finds an industry dealing with significant structural changes, managing the health impact of COVID-19 on practitioners, and bracing for the outcome of Brexit trade negotiations.The human impact of the crisis dominates the responses. Industry talent is in a state of upheaval. 30.8% of organisations are hiring. 29.8% of practitioners have decided to change roles. 23.1% of respondents continue to manage furlough and redundancies. 3.8% of practitioners are looking for work.The #FuturePRoof data is consistent with analysis published by the PRCA three months into the crisis that suggests a significant impact on talent and an overall decline in sector size will occur by 2021.The impact of COVID-19 on the health of public relations practitioners is underreported by trade media. 20.2% of respondents report that at least one team member has contracted COVID-19 and recovered. A further 4.8% say they have employees experiencing long-COVID. Sadly 2.9% have lost a member of staff or have a member of staff who has lost someone in their family.However public relations practitioners appear to be well equipped to deal with the mental health impact of the pandemic. 63.5% of practitioners have drawn on existing organisational support. 36.5% have sought help from industry bodies or other third parties.The strategic role of communications has generally received greater recognition during the crisis. Practitioners have proved resilient and innovative, finding new ways to work and making a significant contribution to their organisation.The majority of practitioners who responded to the survey believe that Brexit is expected to bring further economic and structural pain to the public relations industry and the UK economy. While issues such as the movement of people and standards have been determined, trade tariffs remain up in the air and are unlikely to be agreed until mid-November.\xe2\x80\x9cPublic relations, like other management functions, has been impacted by COVID-19. Practitioners have proved resilient, stepping up and asserting greater value to the organisations that they serve. The reputation and role of the communication function in many organisations has been elevated,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sarah Waddington, founder and editor, #FuturePRoof.\xe2\x80\x9cBut the human stories within this survey have been hard to read and the pandemic is far from over yet. Practitioners have been working flat out and must prioritise their personal health and wellbeing with further potential lockdowns and the outcome of Brexit negotiations to come.\xe2\x80\x9dFrancis Ingham, Director General of the PRCA, said: \xe2\x80\x9cAll around the world, our industry has been hit hard by COVID-19. But thankfully, our worst fears at the beginning of this crisis have proved to be groundless. I stand by the prediction I made some months ago, that by the end of 2020, the industry will be 20% smaller in cash terms, and 10% smaller in terms of headcount. If that\xe2\x80\x99s roughly right, then it could have been a lot worse frankly.\xe2\x80\x9cI also believe that in the medium term our recovery will be strong. This pandemic has massively accelerated the pre-existing trends that play to our strengths, and will therefore make it easier for us to grow relative to other creative industries.\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHaving said that, we have major issues to confront: the need to broaden access to our industry at a rapid pace; the need for many agencies to return to stability and profitability; the challenge of mental health, made all the more difficult by what we have all endured and indeed continue to endure; and of course finding our way forward on what working practices will look like when this is behind us. All tough topics.\xe2\x80\x9cThese #FuturePRoof survey results are a fantastically valuable piece of work at a time like this. Thought provoking. Challenging. Candid. Exactly the qualities we need right now.\xe2\x80\x9dThe #FuturePRoof team has engaged the community and the broader PR industry since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis to understand its ongoing impact on practitioners and their work. The latest research explores the impact of COVID-19 on practitioners in terms of their personal and professional life. It was conducted during September 2020 and led by #FuturePRoof chair Stephen Waddington.104 practitioners responded to the survey from across the UK. These included in-house (37.5%), agency (29.8%), freelance (28.8%) and unemployed practitioners (3.8%). Respondents were predominantly director (55.8%) and manager (26.9%) level.Anecdotal comments provide further insight into the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on practice.\xa0Home and office: blurring of home and work lifePractitioners adapted to home working but missed social interaction and learning opportunities that are a feature of office life. The lack of boundaries between home and office was also a challenge, leading to longer working hours.\xe2\x80\x9cHappy to be back in the office [following the release of lockdown] and have some structure, seeing colleagues, and having the extra physical activity of going into the office.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cHave struggled with the lack of face-to-face time and no travel to punctuate remote working.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cI miss travelling, meeting clients and colleagues, and networking.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cI manage a large team and working virtually for me is fine, others miss the social interaction and softer learning opportunities of working with others in a physical space.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cI worked from early morning to late in the evening every day and into the weekends.\xe2\x80\x9d\xa0Family: overseeing children and extended family challengingPractitioners generally welcomed increased time with partners, children, and other family members although it led to additional challenges, notably home schooling.\xe2\x80\x9c[We] had my partner\xe2\x80\x99s student family member staying with us. That was tough mentally.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cIt has helped me - and us as a family - distinguish between needs and wants, and to value our unit more than ever before.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been a case of doing what you can around young children, a shrinking client base, virtual networking and picking up projects I can squeeze in [\xe2\x80\xa6], often early and late in the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cLong working days, no time off, balancing family and work life, and dealing with the mental impact of adjustments in life and worry about elderly loved ones led to burn out.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cManaging childcare, work and the stress and worry relating to health has been a nightmare.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cJuggling home schooling and work was exhausting.\xe2\x80\x9d\xa0Health and wellbeing: illness and mental healthThere has been a significant focus on mental health in the public relations profession over the past five years. Illness from COVID-19 and mental health have been the biggest health and wellbeing issues during the crisis.\xe2\x80\x9cLosing a partner to COVID-19 has been tough.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve lost family members [\xe2\x80\xa6] and that was hard as I sat through days of them dying and [arranging] long distant funerals.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cWorking for a care provider has been hard. Long hours and often distressing news and updates at our management group which I sit on is impacting me.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cI have experienced a lot more anxiety. I\'ve always had it, but this is the worst it\'s been in a long time. Comes and goes. It\xe2\x80\x99s mostly fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been lucky in that little has changed, however, I\xe2\x80\x99ve struggled to remain productive while working remotely and my mental health is suffering.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cHave felt very flat and tired at times. I\'m exhausted.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cI got made redundant during lockdown, it\xe2\x80\x99s been the most mentally challenging period of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\xa0Business: freelancers left behindGovernment support in the form of business interruption loans and the furlough scheme have been welcomed by the industry as a measure of protection against the financial impact of the crisis, however freelancers and small agencies that pay directors via dividends have been left behind.\xe2\x80\x9cNo government help for limited companies that pay dividends. Worst time but survived.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cHigh debt caused by office space fees has caused high stress levels. The money from bank loans will run out. Many small businesses are facing the same situation, we\xe2\x80\x99re tied into leases with no respite.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a new business entitled to no government support and as primary carer for two young children I have been able to work or earn little in the last six months.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cCOVID-19 saw all my work drop away for three months. Savings were used. No government benefits applied to me unfortunately.\xe2\x80\x9d\xa0Resilience: collaboration and innovation in workAlthough COVID-19 has been disruptive to many aspects of life, many practitioners recognised the opportunity for communications and innovation in practice. These include collaboration, new ways of working and learning.\xe2\x80\x9cLong term, I feel optimistic that COVID-19 has provided opportunities for innovation - new ways of working, connecting, engaging, and communicating.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cProfessionally, it has been liberating and exciting, providing endless scope for collaboration, experimentation, community building and generosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cInvested in the business in the team, equipment and marketing. Now reaping the benefits having recorded record months for invoicing and new business.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cHave also been accepted on the CIM Level 6 professional marketing certificate - sole aim being to widen my skill set further.\xe2\x80\x9d\xa0Role of communicationsThe strategic role of communication has been recognised during the COVID-19 crisis, however it remains a tactical function in many organisations. There is still work to do to ensure management teams value it appropriately.\xe2\x80\x9cWork in the public sector has been incredibly busy, my organisation was already trying to manage significant change and a financial crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cFeel undervalued by employer during the crisis. Very hierarchical organisation and opportunities to advise and engage with executive minimal. Communications still seen as one-way, top down.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cCommunication has been key throughout. It is great that it is getting the profile [it deserves] but it\'s relentless.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cMy workload tripled. This has led to me recognising how little management value or appreciate the [communication function].\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cOur hours have been long, but the team has galvanised around a clear and common goal, which has been energising.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cFrustrated by my organisation leaving communications out of key discussions around staff communications.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been super tough in the NHS but when you compare what we\xe2\x80\x99ve had to do with our frontline colleagues, we have nothing to complain about.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewer PostIs coaching key to solving PR\xe2\x80\x99s racial diversity deficit?Older Post\xe2\x80\x98To bias or not to bias\xe2\x80\x99: The science  behind (bad) decisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.\n\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\nWe respect your privacy.\nThank you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Waddington #PleaseWearAMask\nRT @NorthPowerWomen: Have you been successful with any covid funding/grants?\nOct 14, 2020, 7:20 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Waddington #PleaseWearAMask\nRT @Mrs_Wadds: Here\'s a great #FuturePRoof article from @peterholt99 which explores the possibilities for comms membership bodies\xe2\x80\xa6 https://t.co/FRhuxzpYGi\nOct 14, 2020, 5:45 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Waddington #PleaseWearAMask\nActually, in a small market, scale brings opportunity to invest in innovation and the value proposition (or decreas\xe2\x80\xa6 https://t.co/7rhg9JqmBI\nOct 14, 2020, 4:50 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Waddington #PleaseWearAMask\nRT @ArvindHickman: @shayonislynn: "Behavioural tactics can lead to positive behaviour change; improving personal, professional and fin\xe2\x80\xa6 https://t.co/fsWXlbJY29\nOct 14, 2020, 3:43 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Waddington #PleaseWearAMask\nReally grateful to @Serena @BusinessWire for sharing the @WeArePRoofed #FuturePRoof survey results.
