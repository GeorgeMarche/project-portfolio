About 1,000 protesters have been detained in Jakarta and more than 100 others arrested in other cities, according to police.LoadingThe "omnibus" jobs creation bill, passed into law on Monday, has seen thousands of people across the world\'s fourth-most populous nation take to the streets in protest against legislation they say undermines labour rights and weakens environmental protections.It amended 79 previous laws and was intended to improve bureaucratic efficiency as part of the Indonesian Government\'s efforts to attract more investment to the country.But demonstrators say the law will hurt workers by reducing severance pay, removing restrictions on manual labour by foreign workers, increasing the use of outsourcing, and converting monthly salaries to hourly wages."This is our struggle for our children and grandchildren, and our future generations \xe2\x80\xa6 If it\'s like this our wellbeing will decrease, and we will lack job certainty," Maulana Syarif, 45, who has worked at a motorcycle manufacturer for 25 years, told Reuters in Jakarta.\'I feel a responsibility to the people\' Jakarta\'s metro stations have been attacked during the protests.(AP: Achmad Ibrahim)Indonesia is eagerly courting foreign investors as key drivers of economic growth in a nation where nearly half the population of 270 million is younger than 30.The coronavirus pandemic has also battered the world\'s 16th-largest economy, and it is hoped the laws will cut red tape to spur a quick recovery.Indonesian GDP fell by 5.3 per cent in the April-June quarter, according to Statistics Indonesia. The World Bank expects it to shrink by at least another 1.6 per cent before the year is out.  Indonesia\'s economy is expected to contract significantly in 2020.(ABC News: Graphic by Jarrod Fankhauser)Bahlil Lahadalia, the head of Indonesia\'s Investment Coordinating Board, appealed to young people to trust the Government\'s intent."Please be assured this law is to create jobs for the unemployed Indonesian people," he said.But others beg to differ. Labour union leader Jumisi called for protests to continue until the law was repealed, extending unions\' initial plan for a three-day national strike ending Thursday. Riot police blocked a large crowd of protesters from Jakarta\'s Presidential Palace yesterday.(AP: Achmad Ibrahim)"I feel a responsibility to the Indonesian people," said another demonstrator, IT student Arawinda Kartika, as she marched toward the palace. "I feel sorry for labourers working day and night without sufficient wages or power."Two provincial governors urged the President to issue an emergency decree to cancel the law, they said in their social media accounts.Authorities fear COVID surge from protests Demonstrators have been warned to adhere to social distancing while protesting.(AP: Binsar Bakkara)Fears grew of a surge in coronavirus cases from the protests, which are being held as infection rates are rising in many areas. Indonesia\'s official deaths rose Thursday to 11,580, the highest number in South-East Asia. Indonesia\'s COVID-19 responseSix months on from Indonesia\'s first COVID-19 case, experts say the country is still experiencing its first wave and is yet to see a peak in the outbreak.Read moreSome epidemiologists believe Indonesia\'s coronavirus numbers are significantly higher than official figures suggest. The country has one of the lowest rates of doctors and nurses per head of population globally. National COVID-19 task force spokesperson Wiku Adisasmito expressed concern about "potential spreaders" in the crowds of protesters across the country, especially in Jakarta, the centre of Indonesia\'s outbreak."We remind you that we are still in a pandemic condition, there is a public health emergency," he said as images showed demonstrators in close proximity, many without masks and ignoring social distancing.The Government reported on Thursday that the total number of confirmed cases nationwide had risen to 320,564, including 11,580 deaths. Cases in Jakarta alone stood at 83,372 with 1,834 deaths.AP/ReutersPosted  5ddays agoFriFriday 9 OctOctober 2020 at 1:04am, updated 2ddays agoSunSunday 11 OctOctober 2020 at 10:52pmShareFacebookTwitterArticle share optionsShare this onFacebookTwitterLinkedInSend this byEmailMessengerCopy linkWhatsAppRelated StoriesWhy Indonesia\'s approach to COVID-19 \'is the same as the US\'\'As if there is nothing happening\': Indonesia continues to open up despite record COVID-19 casesEconomic crisis caused by COVID-19 could be worse than health crisis, researcher warnsMore on:IndonesiaAsiaUnrest, Conflict and WarWorkCOVID-19DemonstrationMore on coronavirusSee our full coverage of coronavirusOther languagesABC\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 | \xe6\x96\xb0\xe5\x86\xa0\xe7\x96\xab\xe6\x83\x85\xe7\x89\xb9\xe5\x88\xab\xe6\x8a\xa5\xe9\x81\x93Pandemik virus coronaJohnson used COVID-19 to his advantage.
