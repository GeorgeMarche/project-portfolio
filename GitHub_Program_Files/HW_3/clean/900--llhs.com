About UsWhy LHS?Women currently comprise roughly 20% of cyber security professionals in the workplace. In order to meet the current and projected cyber skills shortage, as well as to keep up with a rapidly changing industry, it is critical to bring a holistic and diverse range of people and skills to cyber professions.
