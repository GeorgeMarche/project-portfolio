His ideas regarding product and strategies has been outstanding. His demand for hearing safety has increased our strategic awareness. Specifically, Dr. Godinez has been instrumental in the development of children headphones that in our opinion maybe revolutionary. In addition he has guided us towards investing in the Hispanic community. We are thrilled and fortunate to have Dr. Godinez on our team. We value him; and have become more excited about the future.
