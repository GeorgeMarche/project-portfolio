focus of new film project\n\n06 October, 2020\n\nBy Megan Ford \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nNurses from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds are being invited to share their experiences of discrimination during the coronavirus pandemic for a new research and documentary project.\n\nAcademics from Sheffield Hallam University have teamed up with film network Migrant Media to launch Nursing Narratives \xe2\x80\x93 Racism and the Pandemic.\nWhile the project will focus on how racism has played out during the Covid-19 crisis it will also document the different forms of discrimination and inequality encountered by BAME nursing staff throughout their careers.\n\nRelated articles:\nYvonne Coghill: \xe2\x80\x98Racial inequality cannot be denied any

risk\n\nThe end result will be a feature-length documentary film set to be launched in autumn 2021 alongside written presentations of the findings.\nResearch for the project will be carried out by academics from the Culture and Creativity Research Institute and the College of Health, Wellbeing and Life Sciences at Sheffield Hallam University.\nProfessor Anandi Ramamurthy, professor of media and culture at the university,\xc2\xa0said the pandemic had \xe2\x80\x9claid bare the structural inequalities of our society\xe2\x80\x9d and she hoped the study could highlight lessons for learning.\n\n\n\nProfessor Anandi Ramamurthy\n"Using creative storytelling we aim to deepen the societal understanding of the critical contribution that BME nurses and care workers have made to the NHS and social care, both historically and today," she said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe stories of BME nursing staff and the pandemic are entwined with complex histories of racism which can only be fully understood through amplifying the experiences and voices of those who have been marginalised.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe hope to develop our understanding of what went wrong in our response to the pandemic and consider what lessons we can learn to create a more equitable society and an NHS that is able to deliver the best patient care.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMeanwhile, Ken Fero, UK documentary filmmaker and co-founder of Migrant Media, said he hoped the documentary would inspire \xe2\x80\x9csignificant change\xe2\x80\x9d.\n"It is important that those who have been on the Covid-19 frontline \xe2\x80\x93 so many of whom have been from Black and migrant backgrounds \xe2\x80\x93 have their experiences documented and their hopes for the future heard," he added.\n\n\n\nKen Fero\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis research is not only focused on collecting stories of racial discrimination and the impact of long-term discrimination on individual and institutional approaches to a crisis.\n\xe2\x80\x9cViewing the \xe2\x80\x98pandemic as a portal\xe2\x80\x99 through which we can re-shape our direction as a society, we will centre the insights of those on the frontline as a crucial asset in creating significant change.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe study had been awarded funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council, following a call from the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) government department for projects to explore the impact of the pandemic.\nThose behind the project are appealing to individuals who would like to be involved in the study to contact the team at nursingnarrativesuk@gmail.com.\nAll image

the team at  \nSo it would seem that this study will use self selected subjects rather than a random selection.  How can any conclusions drawn from such a study be regarded as of any scientific merit?  Which subjects stories will be included in the study?    How will the stories be verified?  What statistical analysis will be used on the subjects stories?\n\nLog in to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave your say\n\n\nSign in or Register a new account to join the discussion.\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\tPlease remember that the submission of any material is governed by our Terms and Conditions and by submitting material you confirm your agreement to these Terms and Conditions.
