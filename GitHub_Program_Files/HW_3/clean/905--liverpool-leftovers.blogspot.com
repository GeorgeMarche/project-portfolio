The image above shows him immediately after his great loss, looking out across the courtyard at Austin Friars into a future that is in some ways meaningless. \xa0But he still has his master, Cardinal Wolsey to serve, and so life continues. \xa0Though the time of quarantine is not shown in the film - and there would have been time for all to stay in the house to not spread infection.\n\n\n\nFor some reason this reminds me of the painting The Annunciation by Botticelli, which we saw when we visited Compton Verney back in 2013. There just happened to be an exhibition of Italian art on when we arrived. Two different collonades, one in damp England following a death, one in bright Italy foreshadowing a birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nMaggie\n\n\nat\n4:17 pm\n\n\n0\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks to this post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday, February 06, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Bumble Bee of the year!\n\n\n\n\nToday has been interesting. \xa0After my rather late bath I finally got dressed and just as was about to come downstairs I looked out of the bedroom window to the River Mersey, and saw what I think is the biggest ship I have seen from here. \xa0Bound for Eastham, the Maracas Bay, 175 metres long! \xa0A chemical/oil products tanker. \xa0She was riding very high in the water, and had a tug boat at her stern. \xa0Later to be followed by Leander, at a mere 145 metres, but similar capabilities and headed for Stanlow. \xa0I didn\'t get to see Leander though, as was rushing to be ready for my Dental Hygienist appointment.\n\nAfter having my teeth thoroughly cleaned and rattled in my skull I sat out in the front porch continuing my re-reading of "Wolf Hall". \xa0A must re-read since we\'re enjoying the BBC2 adaptation so much. \xa0It was surprisingly warm in the sunshine, only had a thin jacket on. \xa0Was delighted to see my first bumble bee of the year briefly. \xa0So briefly I couldn\'t tell what kind it was, but it wasn\'t one of those huge queens you often see in springtime. \xa0Sort of beige-ish, and about standard medium bumble bee size. \xa0But a promise of Spring!\n\nNow I have freezing feet, as I sat out a bit too long and I\'m wearing my posh shoes (have to look respectable when go to the dental practice) and not my sheepskin boots. \xa0The sky is now pearly and beautiful, might grab my boots and go out to sit for a bit longer to watch the colour changes as the daytime ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nMaggie\n\n\nat\n5:22 pm\n\n\n0\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks to this post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday, May 07, 2013\n\n\n\n\n\nRiver Mersey seen from our bedroom window\n\n\n\n\nThe river a sliver of silver\xa0\n\nslashed by the trees\xa0\n\nsoon to green up\xa0\n\nand hide our view of the ships\n\nthe sandbanks and the high tides.\n\n\n\nBounded on the far shore by a skein of amber lights.\n\nProof of roads and people over there.\n\n\n\nFurther away the hills of Deeside,\n\nAnd further still the wilds of Snowdonia.\n\n\n\nAt our old home I could see Snowdon from my bed.\n\nHere I see a river and hills\xa0\n\nbut not a mighty mountain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nMaggie\n\n\nat\n6:09 pm\n\n\n1 comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks to this post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday, March 13, 2013\n\n\n\n\n\nBook cull!\n\n\n\n\nSpent afternoons yesterday and today at our old home sorting stuff to a limited extent.\n\nAfter spending most of the time there yesterday sitting by a nice open fire in the living room with me feeling "carp" we decided to take a look at the books that John had brought down in 5 boxes from the bookcases in our bedroom. \xa0After some time going through them all, we filled 2 boxes to go off to Oxfam, so now only have 3 of those boxes to come back to new home. \xa0I kept a load of stuff that maybe I should have let go? \xa0Neville Shute for one. \xa0Will I ever read them again? \xa0Doubtful. \xa0But I don\'t quite feel ready to let them go yet. \xa0Rather like my Mum\'s china ornaments. \xa0Elizabeth Goudge books too. \xa0And a few more random books!\n\nToday those 2 book boxes went off to our local Oxfam shop, along with a box of stuff from new home too - trousers that don\'t fit John any more, and a couple of DVDs. \xa0I washed the lower side windows in old home living room so I could see the sunsets better. \xa0John will have to wash the top ones, as I can\'t clamber onto a ladder (or the back of the settee) these days to do them due to dizziness - apparently "mild left vestibular disorder" according to the very nice lady neurologist I saw some years ago now. \n\nProgress is very slow! \xa0But anything is better than nothing!\n\nMeanwhile in a pot just outside our new home front door the lilies that we bought at the Chelsea Flower Show last year are beginning to sprout despite the cold weather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\nMaggie\n\n\nat\n8:16 pm\n\n\n2\ncomments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks to this post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlder Posts\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaggie at Port Eliot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Me\n\n\n\n\nMaggie\n\n\nI\'ve had ME/CFS since March 9th 1992.  I am lucky that I got an early diagnosis, and also that I was advised to rest as much as I needed to.  My belief is that because of that I am far less disabled than I might have been...  I can garden still to a limited extent (hubby does all the hard work and I do the fiddly bits) and I\'m rediscovering drawing, knitting, and my love of spinning and textiles.\n\nView my complete
