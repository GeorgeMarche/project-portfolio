The current predictions are between minus 4.9% and minus 2.1%, Harison stated.The inflation rate is currently over 5% in several African countries, he added.The continent needs to raise its manufacturing exports and reduce the use of processed goods to close its fiscal gap, said Harison.COVID19Nail OlpakpandemicRuhsar Pekcan \n\n   \n\n                       Kaydet   Font \n \n    \n
