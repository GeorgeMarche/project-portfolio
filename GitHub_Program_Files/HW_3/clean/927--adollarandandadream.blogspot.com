[Video]\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a\xa0 video of how Black Christians - perhaps the most devout followers of the faith - compare to their White counterparts regarding the role of government and both major political parties throughout American history. In part, it somewhat explains the mental gymnastics some politicians [ex. Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, etc.] exhibited after the shooting at Charleston\'s Mother Emanuel AME Church.\xa0Keep in mind neither party is perfect, and the ear-tickling that appeases to our senses and current perspectives is how we ultimately consume news, rant, vote, and even worship God.\xa0https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10164491304365230&id=658585229(Courtesy of Phil Vischer of Holy Post Videos)\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\n\n\n\nA.

Had the so-called Biblical scholars among us paid attention not only in high school civics and government classes but also to the news outside of their narrow prisms, then they would know the real reason for the Supreme Court verdict back in the 1950s.\xa0As you can tell, this is not a "Leave It to Beaver" type of post which portrayed a simpler period and simultaneously erase if not outright dismiss the conditions for a number of us. A few years ago, MAGAs and their subject of idolatry were asked to find the exact year when America was last great in their minds.The year? 1957.\xa0What was that year like? The interstate system was nearing completion for transcontinental travel for certain families to travel the USA in their Chevrolet Bel Airs, suburbia was still being built with both low-interest loans and covenant agreements, my mom was a newborn, my dad was a ten-year-old, and the Supreme Court decided that prayer in public school could not be led by teachers or administrators. It wasn\'t that long ago.The Engel v. Vitale case heard in the Supreme Court in 1962 states its verdict and proceedings. As a reference, the plaintiffs were Jewish, Unitarian, an atheist, and people who felt a mandatory prayer before school infringed upon students\' rights to a quality education without bias - and due to the atheist, this case becomes a liberal agenda flashpoint for most conservatives akin to Roe v. Wade today. Research the aforementioned case before getting your panties in a bunch.\xa0\n\n\n\nKeep in mind this is in the early phases of the Civil Rights Movement, many of which the most vocal \'christians\' among us were sternly opposed to any Black progress. Need examples? Brown v. Board of Education was in 1954, and Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus got punked by the federal government when troops escorted the Little Rock Nine three years later to Central High School. Then let\'s not delve deeply into the consequences that came from voting but death and unemployment were two of the prices Black people paid.Years later and as early as junior high, I could recall the See You At the Pole festivities on campus as students prayed around the school\'s flagpole for the school year, the nation, and the Christian faith. Disclaimer:\xa0 I did participate in one my sophomore year at Henderson State; this comes from a place of having to find myself as I was torn between what was deemed an acceptable way of being Christlike and a developing worldview that did not quite always allay itself to a strict interpretation of spirituality.\xa0As of 2005, SYATP has gone worldwide with over two million people in collective prayer. This has not gone unnoticed nor without legal bumps in the road as complaints of the 1st Amendment being infringed as the most common allegation with a blurring of official endorsement or interference, according to the Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District\xa0decision of the\xa0US Supreme Court as well as a 1995\xa0Clinton Administration\xa0\xa0assignment of the President\'s\xa0Secretary of Education for legalization of particular school religious activities as long as they passed constitutional guidelines. The\xa0American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) also approves of student-led SYATP events held before or after school, provided the school neither encourages nor discourages participation.In other already reiterated words, prayer in school is cool - it cannot be led by adults, teachers, or pastors on-campus. It is also important for students to know their 1A rights and the limitations of their contextual usage:\xa0 Just because you can yell "Fire!" in a movie theater does not mean it is a good idea.\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\n\n\n\nA.

Let\'s check out how the chicken got picked clean off its bones for sandwiches, salads, pizzas, tacos, or whatever your hearts may desire.INGREDIENTS\xa0One whole chicken, about 5-7 lbs.Table saltBlack.pepperGarlic powder\xa0Poultry seasoning of your choiceStep One. After purchasing the bird and bringing it home, find a safe place to prepare it and do all of the necessary things we do with chicken. Salmonella is a very real thing, and that is the last thing we want to offer up;\xa0 while we\'re at it, put your gloves on and maintain a clean hand when handling poultry.\xa0\n\n\n\nStep Two. You don\'t have to do this, but I trimmed the extra skin as well as cut out the backbone, neck, and giblet for today\'s cook. Once this task is completed, add the seasonings to both sides of the chicken:\xa0 I chose to keep it simple with the aforementioned spices - of course, feel free to make it your own. I might try lemon pepper or my favorite Cajun-style rubs next time around - the reason I went generic this time is to showcase the versatility of pulled chicken.\n\n\n\nStep Three. If you haven\'t already started your grill, get it set up for indirect heat with temperatures reaching 275-325 degrees. On my PK, it simply requires a hand waving test:\xa0 If I can leave my hand over hot coals for more than a few seconds, then it is too cool. You\'d also want the chicken skin to crisp up throughout the cook for an added element to sandwiches (trust me), but bottom line is the breasts will be ready around 165 and thighs, 175.\xa0It\'ll be a little while, so grab a couple of beers or snag a batch of my Dat White sauce. I won\'t divulge the secrets used in making it, but if mayonnaise-based barbecue sauce isn\'t your thing, then you can choose one to your liking. Lately it\'s been Dang! Oh, Mango and The Ancestors, but hey, eat your way.\n\n\n\nI\'m retiring this sauce soon but if you ask me nicely enough and give me $10, I\'ll make you a batch.\n\n\n\nMore of the shameless plug - I\'m the \xf0\x9f\x94\x8cin this thing\xa0\n\n\n\nStep Four. In the miracle of time, the bird is smoked and coming off the grill. Give it about fifteen to twenty minutes to rest before commencing with the chicken pickin\'! For sandwiches, I\'ll use the crispy skin along with the mixed - and obviously - pulled parts of the chicken, and if you\'re doing this for salads, tacos, pizzas, or anything else, do whatever you deem necessary for good eating!\n\n\n\nAs always, thank you for reading the Dub Shack BBQ method of pulled chicken. Get out there and smoke something as every day is a GREAT day for barbecue! Be safe, be blessed, and be good to each other!\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\n\n\n\nA.

How is it that for so long, Black\nwomen end up toting the water from one end of the valley to the top of the hill\nwithout spilling a single drop and yet simultaneously be perpetually\nunderappreciated and disrespected yet show openly all of the grace they were\nendowed with is beyond my feeble understanding. \n\n\n\n\nIf I were you, Id be ready to throw hands or\nsomething. This is too much. \n\n\n\n\nBut this goes beyond Breonna or Sandra or anyone\nelse whose names we have had to mention as in death, they have taken on larger\nroles in our version of Reconstruction 2.0 or the Civil Rights Movement Part II\nor how Black Lives Matter  the movement  will be remembered. I say the movement\nbecause there are too many basic-ass, racist-ass white people who slander our\nclarion call the exact same way their parents and grandparents did Brother\nMartin during the 1960s only to find that they havent changed a bit over the\npast fifty years or so. Sure, we live in the same subdivisions, work alongside\neach other, shop in the same grocery stores, and even cheer on the same teams\n(I wont call the Hogs, but you already know that  my Reddies will be back in\nthe spring), but the failure to acknowledge basic humanity spells a hypocrisy\nthat they and sadly, some Black men may willingly never come to grips with.\nGood use of your platform @theestallion on @nbcsnl #ProtectBlackWomen #savage pic.twitter.com/RzX9yQ6dka mizzkbofficial (@mizzkb100) October 4, 2020 \nIs it our proximity to that deadly drug called whiteness\ntoo strong to resist as you have been consistently failed repeatedly? \nIs it the fact that white America has deemed you\nangry when you show righteous furor, and some of us brothers have been too\nmeek, misogynistic, or pussy to defend your honor? \nIs it the literal interpretation of the King James\nBible followed by many of our churches that limit the roles of women to being\nseen and not heard? \nDo we manage to prove that Brother Malcolm may have\nbeen right when he told us that the most disrespected person in America is the\nBlack woman based solely on how we treat you? \n\n\n\n\nI mean, damn, Black women have literally been the\nbackbone to this country that clearly does not love you back in return  and\nthe shit is really cradle to grave. At best, it is fucked up, and at its worst, Monday. Over the course of these 401 years, you have done more than your fair\nshare of the grind from having to nurse and care for white babies over your own\nduring both slavery and Jim Crow as the powers-that-be in this unequal society\nhave opened a chasm between themselves and everyone else; introduced the world\nto seasoned food; \xa0marched in lockstep in\nthe womens suffrage movement until the white women in charge told them to kick\nrocks like one certain major political party prior to 2020 has done for years;\nreceived patents (see Phillis Wheatley and Dr. Shirley Jackson, among others)\nto improve all of our lives; to the numerous ways of expressing a creativity\nthat finds itself within the lexicon of American culture; unlocked a\nperspective of American history some historians and politicians would prefer\nignored  or worse, forgotten; and fought for the rights of fellow women of all\nstripes to make their own medical choices regarding their bodies as death\nthreats rained upon them. I am also facing my inadequacy as a Black man for not\nalways being able to fully understand the struggle  as I wrote in Hi! Im\nToken, I reflected upon my own past failures for sitting down when it was\ntime to stand up, using inappropriate language, and otherwise being a twit as I\nunwittingly defended the status quo to maintain the aforementioned proximity to\nthe fog that asphyxiates freedom, obscures vision, and even extinguishes taste.\nIn that context, it refers to being that pet, favorite happy Negro, or\nwhatever the hell slight they made to prop me up as someone to emulate. \nWhere would we be without you? \nI am tired of\nfailing you, beautiful Black women.\n\n\n\nYou deserve a LOT better than this damning fate of\nbeing a second-class or tertiary citizen in this land, and honestly, I am standing\nwith you to build our own Wakanda apart from the mess we live with hourly,\ndaily, weekly, monthly, and annually as we try to leave this rock a better\nplace for our chocolate children to grow up safely and mature into the next\ngeneration of heroes, the ones our ancestors can truly be proud of.

Cedric Armstrong (@cedteaches) September 8, 2020 \nThroughout 2020, we have lost a lot of our\nheroes, relatives, contemporaries, and people who have impacted our lives more\nthan we ever imagined.\nKobe Bryant.\nCongressman John Lewis.\nCongressman Elijah Cummings.\nChadwick Boseman.\nGeorge Floyd.\nBreonna Taylor.\nGeorgetown Hoyas mens basketball Coach John\nThompson.\nCountless legends of our hoods and families,\nincluding my own cousin Kavon.\n\n\n\nYet we are told to stay strong through all of the\ncircumstances not only within our own communities but also in the face of sheer\nhatred. But when the strength runs low and we find ourselves alone, we can\nfinally exhaleand we wail. I didnt say cry, nor did I use the word sob: I\nSAID WAIL. \nWailing is OK; sometimes the pain is too great to\nhave to carry alone, and there may be underlying conditions for the visceral\nreactions when we do finally cry. For a season, we have to allow ourselves the\ntime to grieve  and contrary to how visitors see things  in our own way. No\none can legislate how you should feel, nor shall they feel that those sorrowful\nfeelings require a specific expediency to his or her own selfish desires.

They saw you brandish Scriptures to malign him and use the laziest of racial stereotypes in criticizing him.And through it all, White Evangelicalsyou never once suggested that God placed him where he was,you never publicly offered prayers for him and his family,you never welcomed him to your Christian Universities,you never gave him the benefit of the doubt in any instance,you never spoke of offering him forgiveness or mercy,your evangelists never publicly thanked God for his leadership,your pastors never took to the pulpit to offer solidarity with him,you never made any effort to affirm his humanity or show the love of Jesus to him in any quantifiable measure.You violently opposed him at every single turnwithout offering a single ounce of the grace you claim as the heart of your faith tradition. You jettisoned Jesus as you dispensed damnation on him.And yet you give carte blanche to a white Republican man so riddled with depravity, so littered with extramarital affairs, so unapologetically vile, with such a vast resume of moral filththat the mind boggles.And the change in you is unmistakable. It has been an astonishing conversion to behold: a being born again.With him, you suddenly find religion.With him, youre now willing to offer full absolution.With him, all is forgiven without repentance or admission.With him youre suddenly able to see some invisible, deeply buried heart.With him, sin has become unimportant, compassion no longer a requirement.With him, you see only Providence.And White Evangelicals, all those people who have had it with youthey see it all clearly.They recognize the toxic source of your inconsistency.They see that pigmentation and party are your sole deities.They see that you arent interested in perpetuating the love of God or emulating the heart of Jesus.They see that you arent burdened to love the least, or to be agents of compassion, or to care for your Muslim, gay, African, female, or poor neighbors as yourself.They see that all youre really interested in doing, is making a God in your own ivory image and demanding that the world bow down to it.They recognize this all about white, Republican Jesusnot dark-skinned Jesus of Nazareth.And I know you dont realize it, but youre digging your own grave in these days; the grave of your very faith tradition.Your willingness to align yourself with cruelty is a costly marriage. Yes, youve gained a Supreme Court seat, a few months with the Presidency as a mouthpiece, and the cheap high of temporary powerbut youve lost a whole lot more.Youve lost an audience with millions of wise, decent, good-hearted, faithful people with eyes to see this ugliness.Youve lost any moral high ground or spiritual authority with a generation.Youve lost any semblance of Christlikeness.Youve lost the plot.And most of all youve lost your soul.I know its likely youll dismiss these words. The fact that youve even made your bed with such malevolence, shows how far gone you are and how insulated you are from the reality in front of you.But I had to at least try to reach you. Its what Jesus would do.John Pavlovitz\n\n\n\nPS:\xa0 If you wonder why people are leaving the church in droves, perhaps one would be wise to look in the mirror and reflect upon your own actions versus what was said or taught Sunday mornings at 11 am.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted by\n\n\n\nA.
