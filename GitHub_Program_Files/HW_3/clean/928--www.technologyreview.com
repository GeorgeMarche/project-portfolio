In response, criminal justice systems around the world started looking for alternatives to incarceration.\xc2\xa0 Many turned to electronic ankle monitors as a solution. They used this technology to quickly relocate people from secure custody to the relative safety of their homes, and placed them under continuous electronic supervision. At the same time, courts in the US and Australia began to experiment with using ankle monitors for an entirely different purpose\xe2\x80\x94enforcing quarantine orders. The pandemic has subtly normalized the expanded use of ankle monitors around the world. This is a worrisome trend that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow to go unexamined. Previous research suggests that ankle monitors do not conclusively reduce recidivism, and the technology has no history as a tool for enforcing compliance with public health orders. In fact, frequent and long-standing criticism of monitors charges that their use causes significant harm.\xc2\xa0 For example, ankle monitors can impose financial burdens on wearers, who are often required to cover the expense of wearing a monitor themselves: they pay private companies, hired by states and counties, fees in the range of $3 to $35 per day, which can amount to hundreds of dollars per month. Such fee structures have led some to refer to ankle monitors as a present-day debtor\xe2\x80\x99s prison.\xc2\xa0 Furthermore, monitors cause some wearers physical discomfort or pain. And they carry a social stigma because they\xe2\x80\x99re widely associated with the criminal justice system, and with violent offenders specifically. In this sense, being required to wear an ankle monitor is akin to wearing a criminal record on one\xe2\x80\x99s body\xe2\x80\x94like a digital scarlet letter.\xc2\xa0 To make matters worse, ankle monitors are prone to technical glitches such as signal loss and drift, prohibitively short battery life, and inaccurate alerts sent to monitoring agencies. Such errors further complicate the lives of people required to wear them.\xc2\xa0 The recent surge in monitor use unfolded without sufficient concern for wearers or their communities. It\xe2\x80\x99s a clear case of \xe2\x80\x9csurveillance creep\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the growth of surveillance tactics and systems beyond the circumstances for which they were initially intended.\xc2\xa0 Always on Around the world, the rapid spread of covid prompted\xc2\xa0many public health measures that have been intrusive. Dozens of governments began rolling out contact tracing apps. In China, people were required to wear a digital wristband and download the StayHomeSafe app, which worked together to enforce quarantine requirements. Travelers returning to India and Bangladesh received hand stamps that marked them as meant to be in quarantine. In the US, states issued stay-at-home orders and mask mandates. However, unlike these virus-specific measures, the increased use of ankle monitors won\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily end when the health emergency does. Ankle monitors predate the virus, and it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how their heightened use will be reassessed when the virus is no longer a threat.\xc2\xa0 Related StoryPodcast: COVID-19 is helping turn Brazil into a surveillance stateLatin America's largest democracy was a leader on data governance for years. Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s reversing course. Taking decisive action to protect people from the virus shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t preclude careful consideration about technological deployment, especially when there are well-known problems with the technology in question. Electronic ankle monitors were originally inspired by a Spider-Man comic and electronic monitoring equipment for cows, and initially developed in the US to enforce house arrest in the early 1980s. They\xe2\x80\x99re now regularly used in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to enforce supervision orders during probation, parole, and pretrial release.\xc2\xa0 In recent years, ankle monitor use has also spread outside the criminal justice system. They are now used to surveil immigrants who enter the US and Canada without documentation, to monitor truant teens, and to track elders affected by cognitive conditions.\xc2\xa0 From 2005 to 2015, the number of people in the United States who were monitored using this technology increased 140%, from approximately 53,000 to 125,000 people. Bloomberg estimates there are now 25% to 30% more people worldwide wearing electronic ankle monitors as a result of the pandemic. Bloomberg also reported in July that the US Federal Bureau of Prisons, alone, had put approximately 4,600 people on home confinement since the end of March, which was a 160% increase from pre-covid numbers. Criminal justice officials say ankle monitors reduce the financial burden that detention facilities place on the state, while ensuring that people comply with the conditions of their release. Some lawyers have even advocated for their clients\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cright to be monitored,\xe2\x80\x9d arguing that round-the-clock surveillance is preferable to the inhumanity of incarceration.\xc2\xa0 However, these stances relativistically position ankle monitors as \xe2\x80\x9cbetter than\xe2\x80\x9d incarceration, and avoid tough conversations about the barbarism of the devices themselves.\xc2\xa0 Comparisons between ankle monitors and scarlet letters have led some to suggest that altering the form factor (the hardware\xe2\x80\x99s physical size, shape, and appearance) might ameliorate some of the technology\xe2\x80\x99s harms. One city council member in Ohio recently went so far as to suggest that microchipping people would be a suitable alternative, saying that chipping pretrial detainees \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t be inhumane because we do it to our pets.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Sign up for\xc2\xa0The Outcome\xc2\xa0- A newsletter on US election integrity and technology.Sign upStay updated on MIT Technology\n                    Review initiatives and events?YesNoWhile such proposals acknowledge the visual stigma that ankle monitors carry for wearers, these solutions are misguided. They treat human and civil rights issues as a design problem and explicitly advocate for even more invasive forms of tracking.\xc2\xa0 Other efforts to redesign monitors aim to make it easier for law enforcement to analyze the data the devices collect, or make the devices interoperable with other surveillance systems. Meanwhile, the design of the physical monitors themselves stagnates. None of these alleged fixes simultaneously alleviate the technology\xe2\x80\x99s true physical and digital harms. Digital shackles The search for dignified, ethical alternatives to incarceration is an important one, but electronic ankle monitors are simply not an ethically or technologically effective answer. Instead of arguing that ankle monitors are \xe2\x80\x9cbetter than\xe2\x80\x9d the brutality of mass incarceration or a \xe2\x80\x9csolution\xe2\x80\x9d to acute pandemic health crises in prisons and jails, those in the criminal justice system should figure out how to move away from monitors completely, as long as that divestment doesn\xe2\x80\x99t also mean a return to higher rates of incarceration.\xc2\xa0 Without action now, the widening use of ankle monitors during the pandemic risks becoming permanent. There\xe2\x80\x99s been no clear plan for how the expanded use of this troubling technology will be walked back once the pandemic is under control.\xc2\xa0 Social scientists, humanists, government figures, law and policy makers, community members, and technologists must continuously come together and \xe2\x80\x9ctalk across the aisle\xe2\x80\x9d to design a more just, dignified, and humanizing technological future that is attentive to the nuanced needs of varied users and social contexts. We can start by refusing to make or use any more digital shackles, and by refusing to let their creep extend one inch\xe2\x80\x94or one use case\xe2\x80\x94further.
