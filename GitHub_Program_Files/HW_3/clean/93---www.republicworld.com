It also claims that the hospital staff in China has started serving coffee to the patients three times a day. The chemicals that are supposedly present in coffee and reduce the impact of COVID-19 are\xc2\xa0Methylxanthine, Theobromine and Theophylline. They are claimed to stimulate compounds that ultimately ward off the virus. Here is the message:\n\nBreaking News from CNN :-\nDr. Li Wenliang, China\'s hero doctor who was punished for telling the truth about Corona Virus and later died due to the same disease, had documented casefiles for research purposes and had in the casefiles proposed a cure that would significantly decrease the impact of the COVID - 19 Virus on the human body. The chemical Methylxanthine, Theobromine and Theophylline stimulate compounds that can ward off these virus in a human with atleast an average immune system. Whats more shocking is that these complex words that were so difficult for people in China to understand is actually called COFFEE * in India, YES, our regular COFFEE has all these chemicals already in it. The main Methylxanthine in COFFEE is the stimulant caffeine. Other Methylxanthines found in COFFEE are two chemically similar compounds, Theobromine and Theophylline. The COFFEE plant creates these chemicals as a way to ward off insects and other animals. Who would have known that all the solution to these virus would be a simple cup of COFFEE and that is the reason so many patients in China are being cured. The hospital staff in china has started serving COFFEE to the patients 3 times a day, And the effect is finally in *Wuhan "The centre of this Pandemic" has been contained and community transmission has almost stopped.\n\nALSO READ | Fact Check: Was Lincoln Memorial Statue defaced during the US protests?\n\n\n\n(Source: Whatsapp forward)\nALSO READ | Fact check: Did we lose eight years while transitioning to the Gregorian calendar? \nDr Li Wenliang was an ophthalmologist, which means he was an eye specialist.
