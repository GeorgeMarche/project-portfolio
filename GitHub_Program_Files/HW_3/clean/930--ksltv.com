Utah has tested 892,022 people so far, and 81,947 of those tests returned positive.\nThere have been a total of 1,171,162 tests reported.\nThe rolling seven-day average for positive tests is 1,114 per day, and the rolling seven-day average for percent of positive laboratory tests is 13.7%.\nHospitalizations\nThere are currently 237 patients hospitalized with the virus, 86 of which are in intensive care units. Another 14 patients are currently hospitalized as COVID-19 persons under investigation.\nUDOH reports 54.5% of all non-ICU beds and 73% of all ICU beds in Utah hospitals are occupied.\n\n\nDuring Gov. Gary Herberts weekly situational update, Dr. Emily Spivak of University of Utah Health spoke about the alarming increase in hospitalizations.\nAt the U of U hospital, ICU beds are now 95% full.\nAs a physician, a mother, a concerned citizen, I plead with you  wear a mask, Spivak said.\n\n\xa0\nShe said Utahns have the choice to wear masks outside their homes, or Utahns can take a haphazard approach by wearing masks incorrectly or choosing not to wear them at all.\nIf we choose the latter, we can all plan on remaining in this current state of uncertainty, experiencing lockdowns, virtual schools, canceled sporting events, holidays without loved ones, continued economic and financial impacts, and more and more lives devastated by COVID-19, she said.\nSpivak became visibly emotional as she pleaded with Utahns to step up to the challenge of preventing the spread of the virus, noting that frontline healthcare workers are fighting tirelessly to care for patients who have the virus.\nOur staff feels supported, she said, but some of our nurses and doctors are experiencing heartbreaking stories. Were all tired.\nDeaths\nA total of 501 Utahns have died from COVID-19. The following deaths were reported Thursday:\n\nMale, older than 85, Davis County resident, not hospitalized at time of death\nFemale, older than 85, Salt Lake County resident, long-term care facility resident\nMale, between 45-64, Salt Lake County resident, not hospitalized at time of death\nMale, between 65-84, Salt Lake County resident, long-term care facility resident\nMale, between 65-84, Washington County resident, long-term care facility resident\n\nSpivak remarked on Utahs mortality rate, noting that it is among the lowest in the nation. However, she doesnt believe the death toll should be the only marker used to measure the severity of COVID-19.\n\n\nThis disease can be severe, even for people who have no other conditions, she said. We are seeing people who have long-term problems. We cant just use death as the factor to measure the effect of the disease.\nRecoveries\nThe state is considering 60,220 cases as recovered, meaning those patients received a positive diagnosis more than three weeks ago and they have not died.\nFor additional details, visit coronavirus.utah.gov.\n\n\n\n Share \xa0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Top Stories            \n\n\n\n \n\nExclusive: Friends Of Chad Daybell's First Wife, Tammy, Express Concern Over Her Death\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOfficers & Oversight: Do Civilian Review Boards In Utah Have Enough Power?\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStaying Safe: Coronavirus\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStronger Together Utah\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKSL 5 TV Live\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop StoriesCougar Stalks Man For Six Minutes During Run In Utah Canyon (pageviews: 21924)Woman Gives Birth In Truck On US Highway 89 (pageviews: 3508)Utah Reports 1,200 New COVID-19 Cases, 7 New Deaths, 254 Current Hospitalizations (pageviews: 2359)Active Search Underway For Missing Woman At Zion NP (pageviews: 2293)Suspect Identified, Arrested In 10-Year-Old Sherry Black Cold Case (pageviews: 2281)New COVID-19 Hospitalization Record Set In Utah (pageviews: 2033)Suspect Arrested In Sherry Black's Murder Has Criminal Past (pageviews: 1841)Family Grateful For Support After Father Paralyzed In Bike Crash (pageviews: 1831)Utah Reports 988 New COVID-19 Cases, 5 New Deaths, 249 Current Hospitalizations (pageviews: 1458)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile App | Advertise | Contact Us | Careers with Bonneville\n\n\n\nTerms of use | Privacy Policy | Do Not Sell My Data | Copyright Infringement | Licensing  EEO Public File Report | KSL-TV FCC Public File | Closed Captioning Assistance\n\n\xa9 2020 Bonneville International\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
