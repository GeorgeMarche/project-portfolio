During lockdown, children's physical activity levels dropped significantly - we now have more to do now than ever to restore and continue to increase activity levels. We've developed new ways of supporting schools and new interventions that use physical activity to support children's resilience and readiness to learn. If you'd like to find out about the ways we can support you, please get in touch with a member of the team.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhat We Do\nWe work with a range of schools and organisations to demonstrate how physical activity can be used to achieve wider health and social outcomes for young people, such as improved mental wellbeing, better physical health or key life skills. We support schools in Herefordshire and beyond that would like to raise the profile of PE, sport and physical activity, whilst also working with local community organisations to raise the profile of physical activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWellbeing programmes for schools\nWe've been working with partners to develop two interventions, unique to Herefordshire, to support young people's wellbeing and respond to their needs following Covid-19 - all using physical activity of course!\nFind out more\n\n\n\n\n\nStride Away\nWhilst children are away from school, we've got a whole range of ideas, resources and links for physical activity, PE and School Games at home!\nIdeas here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCovid-19  Active Learning within government guidelines\n10-11-2020\nA webinar looking at how physically active learning (PAL) can continue, and thrive, within the current climate\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLow mood in Children and Young People\n18-11-2020\nA webinar focussed on low mood, what to look out for, how to help and what not to say.\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPE Coordinators Meeting November\n24-11-2020\nA half termly meeting for Primary PE coordinators\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nSee All Events\n\n\n\n\n\nStay social with Stride Active\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\tLive or work in Herefordshire? \nTo develop a clear approach to physical activity within the county, Herefordshire Council is producing a Physical Activity Strategy, informed by local priorities & consultation. \n\xf0\x9f\x93\xa2Have your say by completing the survey \xf0\x9f\x91\x89 https://t.co/ABmtysgvjP https://t.co/clIPotkP83\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere is lots of current research discussing how important play and being active is for children post covid.
