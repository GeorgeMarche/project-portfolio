b"beautifuldisasterAmandaAbout MeKo-fiArchive of Our OwnFanFictionTwitterCurious CatTumblrPillowfortAbout me:Hello! I am a 25 year old female living in rural upstate New York, USA.   Some of my passions include working with animals, reading, writing, and anime & scifi.  I am currently writing exclusively for the mdzs fandom (specifically wangxian), but my social media accounts are multi-fandom.  On my social media you may encounter the discussion of other topics such as: animal welfare advocacy, mental health, and chronic illness. These issues are important to me.  My DMs are always open and I'm always excited to meet fellow writers and fandom-goers.  I'm generally a laid back person and easy to talk to. Often you'll find me shitposting, narrating my boring life, and spamming pictures of my two furbabies (both ferrets).  My open DMs also extend to those who are struggling with mental illness and feel they have nobody to talk to. I am here and I've been through it. I can provide peer support and resources if need be.BackDisclaimerDisclaimer:I may talk and write about NSFW and/or potentially triggering topics.
