They'll stay open for now. ","This is what we know so far about the rules, which come into effect on Wednesday: ","Sheffield has one of the highest weekly rates of coronavirus in England, but Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster's rates are all considerably lower. These restrictions, though, cover the whole county and will take effect on Wednesday. ","The Prime Minister launched the three-tier system of local alert levels for England in Parliament earlier, with the Liverpool city region placed in the most serious \"very high'' risk category.","Boris Johnson told MPs that the coming weeks and months would `\"test the mettle'' of the country as it faced a second wave of Covid-19 cases. ","Under the new arrangements: ","- The medium alert level will cover most of England and will consist of the current national measures, including the rule of six and the 10pm curfew. ","- The high alert level reflects interventions in many areas subject to local restrictions, preventing mixing between different households indoors. ","Most areas which are already subject to local restrictions will automatically move into this category, as well as Nottinghamshire, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak. ","Sheffield City Region Mayor Dan Jarvis has also confirmed he's been told by the Health Secretary that South Yorkshire will be in Tier Two","- The very high alert level will mean, at a minimum, the closure of pubs and bars and a ban on social mixing indoors and in private gardens.","The Prime Minister told MPs: ","\"The weeks and months ahead will continue to be difficult and will test the mettle of this country.''","But he added: \"I have no doubt at all that together we will succeed.''

If people can actively think about acts of kindness, and did just one act a day, that would be 65 million acts of kindness a day.","\"In your act of kindness, look for an elderly neighbour, or someone on their own and feeling lonely.

Physical exercise isn't just good for our physical health, I think we underestimate how good it is for our wellbeing and our mental health.","\"If you're feeling down, reach out. Reach out to your friends and family. It's a bit more difficult while we're going to be in the measures that we are, but where you can, using iPhones or iPad, reach out to people, talk to people.","\"People underestimate how difficult things are to deal with if you're not getting a good night's sleep. Get your eight hours sleep, and eat a good diet.","\"Put those three things in place, they are your platform. Then go on Every Mind Matters.","\"But, I will caveat that.

She was flooded back in 2007 too and remembers last November like it was yesterday:","\"It were awful watching it come up because we'd been there before. We didn't have as much notice this time as we did before and it was only when my friend knocked me up at about 8 o'clock and said Sandra, it's coming over...\"","We visited her back in November after it had just happened and she was pulling up her floor boards.","Now her house is back to normal after almost ten months of work - she's had the building dried out, a new floor laid, and new carpets and furniture put in. She's had to live upstairs throughout lockdown.","But she counts herself lucky. Many who were flooded are still in temporary accomodation now, almost a year after the flood.","Sandra says coronavirus has made the recovery so much worse:","\"Living in it, it's soul destroying. It was awful because of lockdown as well. I lived upstairs - I spent most of my time pottering about as best I could but I couldn't get out to the garden, I couldn't get out to the front","\"With lockdown, you couldn't get your furtniture, you were waiting for your stair carpet who said they were coming and then they didn't come. Andd you were like, I want to put my house back. Even when I got it decorated, I still couldn't get my furniture.\"","Back last November, when the Prime Minister visited Doncaster, he committed to a flood summit where local leaders could discuss defences with the government.","Today, it's finally going ahead.","Sandra feels like Bentley has been forgotten, because it's a working class area:","\"Us, we get left all the time. They saved Sheffield and they sent it to us. And that's what they're going to do. I think it'll going to happen for us - I don't think we're out of the woods. And every time we get a lot of heavy rain, then you're thinking god I hope that river's not high.","\"As you get older, life gets harder and I don't think I'll be able to go through this again.","\"I know it's hard because you can't stop water. But for people like us - we've flooded twice, but we've been near a number of times of it coming over - they've got to do something. Because it's not fair - if it were their home they'd be shouting wouldn't they?\"","After the floods in 2007, Sheffield benefitted from millions of pounds worth of new flood defences, but many think other areas along the River Don deserve the same protection.","Sheffield City Region Mayor Dan Jarvis, who's set up the meeting, wants a plan for the whole catchment:","“I’m pleased the Government has agreed to convene this flooding summit. I’m absolutely clear this must not be a one-off session, followed by a return to business as usual.","\"This must be the start of a constructive, ongoing dialogue with Defra and the Environment

This could be based on a network of open-access mental health services based in local communities, which provide immediate support in a non-clinical settings.","• Dept for Educaton should provide schools and colleges with increased mental health resource sooner to roll out Mental Health Support Teams more widely so that they are able to undertake preventative interventions around self-harm more consistently.","• Government bodies should ensure that third sector and community-based organisations are able to continue helping young people who self-harm by providing a sure financial footing for the future.","You can read the Executive Summary of the report [here](https://media.samaritans.org/documents/APPG_inquiry_executive_summary.pdf){:target=_blank}.","And listen to the award-winning

","He said: \"I do sympathise with the clubs outside the Premier League because they rely on supporters coming through the door. ","\"From a business point of view they've taken huge hits and hopefully everybody will come through it, but there has to be a concern about what's going off at the moment. ","\"Nobody wants any club to go by the wayside, we've talked about it far too many times already recently with Bury and other clubs. Bury are a club with over 100 years of history and have gone in a heartbeat through mismanagement. ","\"Regardless of what the administrators of the Premier League do, it will be decided by the Premier League clubs. ","\"If anything can be done by the Premier League and they make a decision collectively, if they make a decision to help then we would.'' ","Wilder recognises the wider importance of football in communities, not just among professional clubs but lower down the pyramid as well. ","He added: \"We're extremely proud of all the clubs that are strong and keep the area going, and what football plays in this part of the world is huge. ","\"We're not a one-club city and we're not a two or three-club area, football is a huge part of life in South Yorkshire and it has to be protected in my opinion.''"],"primarySyndicatePosition":0,"published":{"state":"published","wasPublished":true,"scheduledStart":1600781699,"scheduledEnd":null},"hidePublicationDate":false,"hiddenArticle":false,"heroImageSize":"full","author_custom":"","publicationDate":1601040127979,"sourceUrl":"","sourceText":"","pageTemplate":"article","target":"international","toplistFeature":false,"isAdvertorial":false,"campaign_name":"","rating_extras":"","rating":"","verdict":"","nutshell":"","excerptOverride":"","urlOverride":"","canonical":"","metaDescription":"","metaTitle":"","trackingScript":{},"ospLinkOverride":"","openGraphDescription":"","openGraphTitle":"","excludeFromFBIA":false,"excludeFromAppleNews":false,"excludeFromCDP":false,"saveHistory":{"fullname":"Jaimielee

me.’","“You know your own child better than anyone, but building on that strength, keeping that communication open, talking to them about how life is, particularly at the moment, whether they are at work or not, whether they are in school or not, it’s about finding ways to keeping the conversation going.”","Suicide is the main cause of death in young people – male and female – under the age of 35 in the UK.","Papyrus is a charity dedicated to bringing those numbers down, and they have a range of resources available to help you make the right connection with someone who may be struggling.","If you want to know more, here’s a link and resources from the Papyrus website: [www.papyrus-uk.org ](http://www.papyrus-uk.org ){:target=_blank}","If you would like to speak to someone at [Hopeline UK](https://www.papyrus-uk.org/hopelineuk/){:target=_blank}, the number is **0800 068 4141**.","Natalie is one of their advisers, she’s been telling Senior Correspondent Mick Coyle what people can expect when they pick up the phone.","Events are taking place across the globe to mark World Suicide Prevention Day.","Here's a video the organisers of #WSPD2020 want the world to see:","If you want to find mental health services where you are type your postcode into [www.hubofhope.co.uk](http://www.hubofhope.co.uk){:target=_blank}.","There, you can also find links to The Samaritans.","And you
