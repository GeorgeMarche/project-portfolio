@garyvee You know it, Mister V.  Happy Thanksgiving.

@WilRod123 @satyanadella @Microsoft I'll step down if you want to run Skype. :)

@WilRod123 @satyanadella @Microsoft So much potential. And of course they'd pay a million. If I bring them hundreds of millions in value. :)

@ZacharyCohn How true.

@mattmetten With years of advances before the other guys even showed up. Alas. A tragedy.

@jennyjenjen @rizzn Remember when?

@mattmetten But it *used* to be *the* best video/audio communications tool in the world.

@rizzn So depressing. How could "integral communications platform" not be central to *any* version of MSFT strategy?

Microsoft: make me in charge of Skype for 1 year. If I turn it around, gimme a million bucks to go away.

@fooconner Hahahaha. Exactly. (But c'mon - gimme Skype. I could turn it around!)

@tedmurphy Oh, I watched you munching it up. Who could avoid any of THAT magic?

Not everything is meant to be scalable.

Dear whoever runs Skype - you used to be the frontrunner. Now you're just wandering around copying other people's designs. Stop it. Lead!
