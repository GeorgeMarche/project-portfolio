@bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Static fire is not risky from build site, but we need to clear the build site for early flights

@nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Just a static fire tomorrow. Flight no earlier than Wednesday.

@ErcXspace @SpaceX It will have landing legs

@eugenelee3 @PPathole @karpathy Yes, very sad news. Tony was great.

@PPathole @karpathy For a second there, I thought that was a pic of Thanos haha

@dburkland @ID_AA_Carmack Probably going to a wider beta in ~2 weeks

@ID_AA_Carmack fp16 with least important digits truncated (so it feels like fp32) is what were betting on for training with Dojo
