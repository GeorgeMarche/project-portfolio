No War With Iran! 
 
Iran: Trump Brings Region Closer to War

The murder of Soleimani, while a blow to the Iranian regime, will also act to reinforce it at a moment when it is facing its biggest internal challenge from mass opposition since the 1979 Revolution. Read more...

Remove Trump for his Real Crimes
By insisting on focusing the public’s attention on the narrow issue of Ukraine, the Democratic leadership have proven themselves uninterested in launching an effective fightback against Trump’s real crimes: emboldening white supremacists, abuses at the border, attacking women’s rights and workers’ rights, ripping up of environmental regulations, enriching his own family at the public’s expense, and more. 

How Can Bernie Win? Getting Organized to Build the Movement for Socialism
Bernie should call for mass demonstrations and direct action across the country to bring together union activists, climate strikers and all those fed up with the Trump regime while also emphasizing a positive program to fight back against the entire billionaire class. Read more...

Tax Amazon: Strike While the Iron is Hot
 By Kshama Sawant
"I believe there is a similar momentum now for the Amazon Tax as there was for $15, following elections where each became the defining issue. Our movement again needs to be prepared to go all the way to the November ballot."

Please check SocialistAlternative.org regularly for the socialist analysis, strategy, and tactics needed to build movements to defeat the billionaire class.
 
Our pages build on the proven strategies that won two historic victories for Kshama Sawant in Seattle. Our editorial team brings the experience of leading the fight for $15 to its first major victory in the nation in Seattle in 2014 and then in Minneapolis last year.

Dear George,

I’m writing to give you a quick update about the status of our $5,000 match that was issued by an anonymous donor for #GivingTuesday. To those of you that have already donated – THANK YOU SO MUCH! Your support will enable us to carry our programs forward into 2021!

For those of you that have not yet donated – there is still time! We are less than $1,000 from meeting our goal of a $5,000 match. We need your support as we end 2020 so that we can continue to provide support for families in our area!

Watch the video of Chris below as she explains the impact of how the Open Doors program helped her stay in her training program!
Chris's Story
Please help us meet our goal by making your gift today! Don’t forget – if you sign up with a $10 or more monthly gift, we will freeze your membership rates. Click here for more details.

Thank you,

Dear Mr. Marche,

My name is Jeff Gross and I’m the recruiter here at TMC Technologies. I'm hoping you might be interested in exploring your opportunities with us at NSWC Dahlgren. We are looking for a Software Engineer to join our Computer Program Engineering Services (CPES) team I think you could be a great fit. The CPES team supports AEGIS and associated US Navy combat systems/simulations. This is work that our company has held since 2003, and the current iteration of our contract goes until at least September 2023. This would be a full-time direct hire.

You can find more information about TMC at www.tmctechnologies.com. We offer full family benefits, tuition reimbursement, and 401k with 4% matching. TMC is a small business (106 employees), so we are able to provide an individualized experience that our competitors cannot match. We also continue to make a serious positive impact – our engineers at NASA IV&V played a major role in the development of West Virginia’s first spacecraft, Simulation-to-Flight (STF-1), and we have been a long-time provider of engineering services for the US Navy, FBI, and US Air Force. If you’re even considering making a change, we’ll make it worth your time to check out what we have to offer.

We would be thrilled to have the opportunity to bring you on board. If you’re at all interested in joining our team, please respond to this email or give me a call anytime at 540-320-4019. You can also connect with me on LinkedIn if you’d prefer. I truly appreciate your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Jeff Gross
TMC Technologies Recruiter
