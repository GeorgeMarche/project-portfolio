Study Group - Why Venezuela's Dec. 6 Election Is Legitimate


Friday, December 4th
7pm
Register here

Venezuela has faced relentless attacks from the U.S. government and its allies ever since Hugo Chavez was democratically elected in 1998 and the Bolivarian Revolution began to use the country’s resources for the common good. The majority of working class Venezuelans, having participated in the country’s transformation to build a more equitable society, have successfully resisted all efforts to overthrow the government.

On Friday we’ll hear from a PSL DC member who returned to Venezuela to report on the situation leading up to the election. We will also talk about recent articles from the ANSWER Coalition analyzing events in the country. Among the topics, we anticipate discussing how Venezuela’s electoral system is widely lauded as being among the best in the world. This, as many of us know, stands in sharp contrast to the U.S. system which has – once again – become an embarrassment around the globe.

Borrow responsibly
We encourage students and families to start with savings, grants, scholarships, and federal student loans to pay for college. Students and families should evaluate all anticipated monthly loan payments, and how much the student expects to earn in the future, before considering a private student loan.



This email contains an advertisement/solicitation from Sallie Mae, P.O. Box 3319 Wilmington, DE 19804-4319.

This information is for undergraduate students attending participating degree-granting schools. Borrowers must be U.S. citizens or U.S. permanent residents if the school is located outside of the United States. Non-U.S. citizen borrowers who reside in the U.S. are eligible with a creditworthy cosigner (who must be a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident) and are required to provide an unexpired government-issued photo ID to verify identity. Applications are subject to a requested minimum loan amount of $1,000. Current credit and other eligibility criteria apply.

1 Loan amount cannot exceed the cost of attendance less financial aid received as certified by the school. Sallie Mae reserves the right to approve a lower loan amount than the school-certified amount. Miscellaneous personal expenses (such as a laptop) may be included in the cost of attendance for students enrolled at least half time.

2 This promotional benefit is provided at no cost to borrowers with loans that first disburse between July 1, 2018 and April 30, 2021. Borrowers who reside in, attend school in, or borrow for a student attending school in Maine are not eligible for this benefit. No cash value. Terms and Conditions apply. Please visit chegg.com/studystarter/termsandconditions for complete details. This offer expires one year after issuance.

3 Interest is charged throughout the life of the loan—beginning with disbursement, during school, through any grace/separation period, and ending when the loan is paid in full. With the Fixed and Deferred Repayment Options, the interest rate is higher than with the Interest Repayment Option and Unpaid Interest is added to the loan’s Current Principal at the end of the grace/separation period. Payments may be required during the grace/separation period depending on the repayment option selected. Variable rates may increase over the life of the loan.

4 Although we do not charge a penalty or fee if you prepay your loan, any prepayment will be applied as outlined in your promissory note—first to Unpaid Fees and costs, then to Unpaid Interest, and then to Current Principal. 

5 Based on a comparison of approval rates for Sallie Mae Smart Option Student Loans for Undergraduate Students who applied with a cosigner versus without a cosigner during a rolling 12-month period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019.

Sallie Mae loans are made by Sallie Mae Bank.

MARY TALKS COMMUNICATIONS

View in browser

Black banner with white Mary Talks logo and headshots of Dr. Johnson and Dr. Landphair
Join us ONLINE for the next Mary Talk of the 2020-21 academic year!

In January 2020, UMW launched Farmer Legacy 2020: A Centennial Celebration and Commitment to Action to recognize what would have been the 100th birthday of Dr. James Farmer, national civil rights icon and Mary Washington College professor from 1985 to 1998. While the pandemic changed the direction of our yearlong commemoration, it did not shake our commitment to honor Dr. Farmer and to realize his vision for a more equitable America. Our next Mary Talk will explore Dr. Farmer's life and legacy and his ongoing impact at Mary Washington today.

This Talk will be presented by Farmer Legacy co-chairs Dr. Sabrina Johnson (Vice President for Equity and Access) and Dr. Juliette Landphair (Vice President for Student Affairs) along with Jason Ford '20 (leader of the Black Alumni Affinity Group). They will discuss Dr. Farmer’s impact and UMW’s ongoing commitment to inclusive excellence. We will hear from alumni who recall Dr. Farmer as a remarkable historian and teacher. We will recount our trip with President Troy Paino and others to Capitol Hill to visit the legendary Representative John Lewis, who participated in the Freedom Rides with Dr. Farmer and served as the Farmer Legacy’s honorary Chairperson. We will examine the context of Dr. Farmer’s life and legacy as well as our progress in equity and inclusion efforts at UMW.

Wednesday, December 9
7:30-9:00 p.m.

Online

To watch the Talk online, register here. You then will receive a link to the streaming video, which can be watched live or at a later time. You also will have the opportunity to submit questions to be asked of the speaker at the end of the Talk.

Note: Online viewing is the only option for this Mary Talk, as we are not conducting any in-person events at this time.

We look forward to seeing you online!

New York Times: With Senate Control Hanging in Balance, ‘Crazytown’ Cash Floods Georgia

George,

Democrats are drastically being outspent in the Georgia runoff races. Corrupt Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler have a $28 MILLION ad advantage leading up to the January 5 runoff.

And with early voting starting in just 21 DAYS, we can’t allow ourselves to be outspent in these critical races.

Can you pitch in $35 or more to help close the gap on the GOP’s spending advantage? If you donate before midnight, your gift will be MATCHED by 500% >>>
 
If you've saved your payment info with ActBlue Express, your donation will process immediately:
 
5X MATCH $5	5X MATCH $35
5X MATCH $50	5X MATCH $100
5X MATCH $250	5X MATCH $500
5X MATCH $1000	Other

The first major poll in the runoff races shows that this is a dead heat election.

If we don’t close the gap on the GOP’s spending advantage, we could see our chance to take back the Senate slip away.

That’s why we need you to rush $35 or more to help us fight back. All donations will be MATCHED by 500% before midnight!


 
Democratic Victory PAC is the pioneering Democratic grassroots organization dedicated to defeating Trump, holding the house, and taking back the Senate majority. Donate now for a Democratic victory in 2020.

This will be the most consequential election of our lifetimes, and we're mobilizing online grassroots communities to stand up against Trump's hateful rhetoric and harmful agenda. Together we can help elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and sweep Democrats into office across the country.

Friend,

The final results of the election have now been certified, and with a win margin of just 1.8%, our race was the 8th tightest House race in the entire country.

We always knew it was going to be a close race – VA-07 had gone for Trump by 7 points in the last presidential election, after all.

Here’s how we won: we ran a strategic and aggressive voter outreach program. And the hard work paid off – with over 78%, our district had the highest voter turnout of all congressional districts in Virginia this year!

VA-07 had the highest voter turnout in all of VA. Thanks for all the help!
Throughout this campaign, we told you that we weren’t taking anything for granted. Every postcard we wrote, every sign we delivered, and the tens of thousands of phone calls we made each made a huge difference.

We used social media and digital marketing in new and innovative ways to communicate about expanded early voting opportunities and to encourage residents to make a plan to vote. We ran positive, issue-based ads on television to talk about Abigail’s record of hard work for the people of Central Virginia.

Here’s another way to look at our success: we had the second-highest improvement in turnout from 2016 in all of Virginia. This positive shift in turnout is hard, on-paper evidence of the way that this team was able to urgently and effectively mobilize voters this year.

GIF showing Turnout by Congressional District. Percentage Increase in Voter Turnout, 2016-2020. Abigail's district had the second highest improvement in turnout from 2016 in all of Virginia.
Thank you for believing in our people-focused campaign and supporting our work. We look forward to building on our organizing and outreach in this Central Virginia community in the years to come. With a phenomenal candidate like Abigail at our helm, we can continue to make history.

Thank you,

Bettina
Campaign Manager

STRAIN OF THE MONTH

GSC, formerly known as Girl Scout Cookies, is an OG Kush and Durban Poison hybrid cross whose reputation grew too large to stay within the borders of its California homeland. With a sweet and earthy aroma, GSC launches you to euphoria’s top floor where full-body relaxation meets a time-bending cerebral space. A little goes a long way with this hybrid, whose THC heights have won GSC numerous Cannabis Cup awards. Patients needing a strong dose of relief, however, may look to GSC for severe pain, nausea, and appetite loss.

Historic Congressional vote to legalize marijuana is expected later this week

Democratic House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland) announced over the Thanksgiving weekend that the MORE Act, which would end the federal prohibition of cannabis, has been scheduled for a full floor vote this coming week.

A House vote to end federal prohibition could happen as early as Wednesday. But it’s expected to stall in the Senate.
The vote could happen as early as Wednesday evening.
Advocates expect the bill to pass; House leaders typically don’t bring a measure to the floor unless they know they have the votes. Passage of the MORE Act would mark the first time that the House or the Senate has ever voted as a full chamber on legislation to end the federal cannabis prohibition since it went into effect following the passage of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.

Join us for the People's Day of Action
George,

Thanks to record-breaking youth turnout in the 2020 election, we took back the White House and elected Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

Our generation showed up, and now we demand action. We gave the incoming Biden-Harris administration a powerful mandate to be the most progressive presidency in modern U.S. history — and we expect them to deliver.

If you agree that the Biden-Harris administration should get to work on a bold, progressive agenda from day one in the Oval Office, add your name to our petition to help hold them accountable.

This election wasn’t just about reversing the damage done to our country over the last four years. We can’t just turn back the clock — we must provide real, transformative solutions for everyday Americans.

Throughout the 2020 campaign, Joe Biden presented a vision for our country that would put working families first. Now we’re holding him to his word — and pushing for an even more ambitious agenda.

Sign our petition: Urge President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to enact a transformative, progressive agenda from day one.

Together, I know we have the power to rebuild our country and put our futures on a better path forward.

Thank you,

Kolin Kearns

Dear Friend,

It’s hard to believe it, but COVID-19 is surging once again across the country and in the Commonwealth. Nationwide, we’re fighting 11.3 million cases and mourning 247,000 deaths and counting. 

In these past two weeks, however, we’ve seen what could be a light at the end of the tunnel with promising early data from two pharmaceutical companies who have been working to develop a vaccine against this virus. Personally, I’ve worked with my colleagues in Congress to secure the additional funding that helped safely accelerate the development of these vaccines and I’m going to continue doing everything possible to support the effort to get a vaccine out to the public as soon as it is safe to do so.

But while we wait for official vaccine approval, we cannot let our guards down. The best way to keep yourself and your community safe against this virus is still to wear a mask, practice social distancing, wash your hands often, and follow all public health guidance.

It’s also crucial that you have the care you need right now – especially since nearly 6 million Americans have lost their health coverage during this economic crisis. So if you or someone you know needs to get covered, there’s no better time to sign up for health insurance than right now. Open enrollment closes after December 15, so don’t delay.

I also encourage Virginians to consider ways to safely celebrate Thanksgiving and the forthcoming holidays, because as these celebrations get closer, so does the cold weather and flu season.

I am confident that we will get through this together. In the meantime, I urge you to visit the COVID-19 updates page on my website for more COVID-19 resources and to see a full list of what I’m doing to fight for Virginians during this time.

And if you want to share your thoughts about an issue that’s important to you, you can send me an email any time using the form on my Senate website. You can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,



 
Sen. Mark R. Warner

Research Unlocks New Information About Reading Through Visual Dictionary in the Brain
University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston via ScienceDaily
The uniquely human ability to read is the cornerstone of modern civilization, yet very little is understood about the effortless ability to derive meaning from written words. Scientists have now identified a crucial region in the temporal lobe, know as the mid-fusiform cortex, which appears to act as the brain's visual dictionary.

Laughing Is Good for Your Mind and Your Body, Here's What the Research Shows
The Conversation via Neuroscience News
Amusement and pleasant surprises – and the laughter they can trigger – add texture to the fabric of daily life. Those giggles and guffaws can seem like just silly throwaways. But laughter, in response to funny events, actually takes a lot of work, because it activates many areas of the brain: areas that control motor, emotional, cognitive and social processing.

Basketball On the Brain: Neuroscientists Use Sports To Study Surprise
Princeton University via ScienceDaily
Neuroscientists tracked the brains and pupils of self-described basketball fans as they watched March Madness games, to study how people process surprise -- an unexpected change of circumstances that shifts an anticipated outcome. They found that that shifts in the pattern of activity in high-level brain areas only happened at moments that contradicted the watchers' current beliefs about which team was more likely to win.

Underwater Photographer Captures the Unique Beauty of Swimming With Humpback Whales
My Modern Met
Whether we look to nature, religion, art, or community, much of the human experience involves the act of searching for something bigger than ourselves. For Australian photographer Jem Cresswell, this meant diving into the vast ocean. Since a young age, has immersed himself in underwater photography, finding a sense of awe in exploring the immeasurable depths of the ocean. In 2014, he began photographing an intimate underwater portrait series of a subject much larger than himself: the humpback whale. Now, the series of stunning black and white images is available as a fine art book entitled Giants.

The State of Peoples Unity Address








John Bachtell

CPUSA Chairman
 



Good evening and thanks for tuning in. My name is John Bachtell. I’m the national chair of the Communist Party USA.  Welcome to our response to the State of the Union address. Our country and the world are at a crossroads. Both humanity and nature face existential crises. We face a climate catastrophe and an escalating nuclear war danger.

We are at a crossroads where a just a few billionaires concentrate extraordinary wealth while millions of working-class families barely make ends meet. And despite Trump’s false picture of the economy, wages are stagnant. Many having given up looking for work.

We are at a crossroads where youth are mired in mountains of college debt. Where African American, Native and other youth of color confront generational unemployment, and where social inequality has grown.
